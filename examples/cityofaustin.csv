LOBBY THE APPRAISAL DISTRICT AND TEXAS LEGISLATURE TO CHANGE THE WAY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE APPRAISED SO THEY ARE NOT INCREASED UNLESS A PROPERTY IS SOLD.
10,INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
11,Be more diligent with our property taxes/bonds. We vote yes for bonds but it takes 2-3 years to enact. By then things have changed and more expensive and often too late. Stop spending years on feasibility studies. $8 million on CodeNEXT. Those are my tax dollars as a home owner!
12,"Don't forget the original Austinites! We are still here but barely, between the rent rates and cost of living, its cheaper to move outside of Austin and commute.

The cost of living and pay gaps need to be remedied and PEOPLE need to be the focus in order to maintain the true character of the city."
21,"Austin is so spread out it's difficult to get around effectively without a car, even when one really wants to do so."

35,AS WE TRANSITION TO A BIG CITY MORE ATTENTION NEEDS TO PUT ON AFFORDABILITY TO CITIZENS WHO WERE ALREADY HERE AND NOT THOSE RELOCATING HERE.
36,Affordable housing
37,"Rethink creating bait to draw in illegals, homeless, vagrants and gays.  I have nothing against any of these but think Austin  is wrong to encourage their moving here.  If they move here without our programs designed to draw them here. that's fine. If tough love is good for kids it's good for Austin."

49,The new homeless shelter to be put on Ben White is a scam.   How did the city pay close to three to the value of the property?  Place homeless shelters outside of business and residential areas

53,Austin needs diversity and affordable housing.
54,"Tell the Mayor that, ""he is doing a good job"", but I know it takes time to get things in order.  To keep the homeless camps cleaner."
55,"Homelessness - I believe we are too laxed in addressing this issue on our city. Though we need to be compassionate, we also need rules, laws, ordices that address where they can setup their tents, trash that is left around their areas, panhandling, roaming through residential neighborhoods, etc..."
56,More affordable housing
57,Be inclusive of all Austinites and not just your circle.  We all something to bring to the table not just the loudest people.

85,Planning for change and addressing the issue of the cost of living in Austin
86,"Hard job to dissuade zealots and bigots to your moderate mind-set philosophy. Had to start affordable housing all the way at Wells Branch in PVille!! Don't give up trying to convince the State Reps to lower taxes and the speed in which taxes are raised yearly, creating this negative  impact on the ingenious population on the Eastside of Austin, unless this is the intent.

203,"THE HOMELESS DOWNTOWN. THE NUMBER IS GROWING TOO FAST. I UNDERSTAND WE WILL HAVE THIS PART OF SOCIETY TO HELP, BUT NOW I CANNOT GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT EVERY CORNER BEING OCCUPIED OR BEING APPROACHED. I HAVE BEGUN TO LIMIT MY WALKING EXPERIENCE DURING THE EVENING."
204,Keep the homeless areas  clean. Like benwhite& manchaca
205,"Austin is growing rapidly and the city needs to account for that more efficiently. I know many people agree that highways and housing need more attention.

222,"I'm sure you agree that the traffic and lack of public transportation options have been an ongoing issue. 
 I am also concerned with the amount of homeless that have taken up residence on public land, which has increased the amount of litter and trash. 
The remodel of our house has gone on for two years due to the inspectors contradicting each other with each visit, causing thousands of dollars in excess of budget."

255,"DO THE AUDIT, THE HOMELESS GET AWAY WITH TOO MUCH."
256,SANCTUARY CITIES LIKE AUSTIN ARE ON A PATH FOR DISASTER.
257,"Cut frivolous programs, leave the social programs to charities, focus on city infrastructure, police, fire, and ems. Lower property taxes. Austin citizens should not be considered an bottomless piggy bank."
258,Please create a way to keep your musicians here by making it affordable to live here. We are leaving by the dozens. We are the very reason people are drawn to Austin. Please!
259,INCREASE PUBLIC EDUCATION/ INFORMATION ABOUT POLLUTION AND LITTERING
260,KEEP CITY OF AUSTIN OPEN AND FRIENDLY
261,TRAFFIC CONGESTIONS
262,SCOOTERS ARE DANGEROUS AND VIOLATE CITY RULES.
263,Thank you for being the positive change that Austin needs in order to make this city an outstanding community.
264,I HAVE NO FAITH IN THE CITY COUNCIL LISTENING TO THE RESIDENTS. OVERCROWDING.
265,"My land value increased $50,000, with no improvement of services.  Traffic is horrible, both want to make me leave Austin."
266,"VOTE WITH RESIDENTS IN MIND, WE ARE FEELING LARGELY IGNORED BY THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL."
267,WE PAY THE CITY MANAGER WAY TOO MUCH TO STILL HAVE SO MUCH WASTE AND WE ONLY EVER HEAR ABOUT RAISING TAXES. YOU NEED TO HOLD THAT MANAGER ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND STOP HAVING YOUR CITIZENS BAIL OUT AN INEFFECTUAL CITY GOVERNMENT.
268,RESCIND THE CALIFORNIA TYPE ORDINANCES BEING ENABLED. IT IS A NIGHTMARE LIVING THERE-WE DON'T NEED THAT HERE
269,"STOP WASTING MONEY ON THE HOMELESS OR PUT A SHELTER IN TARRYTOWN. FOCUS ON ROADS,POLICE, FIRE AND BASIC CITY SERVICES. FOCUS ON GROWTH. ITS HAPPENING WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. THE CITY IS GOING DOWNHILL"
270,Change is inevitable but not always a good thing.
271,"BETTER BALANCE INTERESTS OFLONG TIME NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS WITH DENSITY/GROWTH NEEDS. DON'T GIVE AWAY TO DEVELOPERS AT EXPENSE OF LONG TERM RESIDENTS. ESPECIALLY DON'T REDUCE PARKING REQUIREMENTS FORDEVELOPERS AND MAKE THEM BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS-NOT JUST TOSS PENNIES INTO A JAR, WHILE THEY CONCENTRATE ON LUXURY UNITS."
272,"RUN OUR CITY LIKE A BUSINESS, IT REAKS OF CORRUPTION."
273,Make it more affordable for the middle class that built Austin.  It's really unfair that we have to spend 60 minutes in a car going to and from work in the City Center fighting traffic every day!
274,Stop worrying about what popular and do what's right for the city. Not a special group
275,"Increase the recycling rate, ban use of single plastic and Styrofoam."
276,"Why are you providing services, even lawyers, to illegals, but not to US citizens living under bridges?  Stop raising my taxes to help not citizen criminal(illegal crossing is a crime just like trespassing, breaking and entering, etc.)"
277,"Homeless camps everywhere!! You allow them to:
Trash our city! Anyone else would be ticketed!!! No city clean up - you want to give in to trash and camps, yet you do nothing to CLEAN UP!!
Needles everywhere
ALLOW FIRES in city limits and in the woods where a wild fire could start!
I pay plenty in taxes for what??
You have created 3rd world conditions in our city!!!
Where do you think these folks defecate!
Now in our neighborhood at night using our electric outlets and water sprockets!!
City Council has destroyed quality of life for those of us who pay taxes/follow the law etc.
This city accommodates this group of folks and yet many refuse services and would rather be out enjoying the street life and free squatting rights!!
Austin use to be the cleanest city in Texas and you have destroyed that!! You should be embarrassed!!! Joke of a council!!"
278,Get serious about traffic issues.  Revision of City's building code situation.
279,PRIORITIZE MASS TRANSIT
280,REPAIR STREETS!
281,Please continue efforts to increase housing affordability in  Austin.
282,Realize you screwed up on the Homeless issue and try to work with TXDOT and CTRMA to get traffic moving.
283,"Fix traffic, fix zoning and code compliance and address skyrocketing housing costs."
284,"You can't please all the people all the time, yes. But Mr Adler, you are on the wrong side of the fence. Especially with the homeless issues and that ordice. Disrespectful of all hard working, tax paying Austin residents and families. We are no longer safe with the homeless crazies running a muck with no recourse for their crazy behaviors. Tweak that ordice back a bit. So crimes like assault,  burglary, indecent exposure, etc. are addressed by APD."
285,Fix Traffic
286,Defeat San Antonio in the breakfast taco war!
287,The changes to the homeless ordice has decreased the safety of people that work downtown
288,FOCUS ON HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CITIZENS AND FIXING ROAD SYSTEM.
289,It's getting too expensive to live here!
290,PLEASE STOP THE HOMELESS COMING FROM OTHER PLACES. PLEASE USE THE CAMERAS AT INTERSECTIONS.
291,Affordable housing
292,Do not limit transportation discussions to mass transit and bike lanes. invest in major hwys and major streets. consider another bridge across the river.
293,Not all are wealthy. City has lost perspective and touch with its former self.
294,welcome an external audit
295,light rail? use the Bergstrom spur to connect AVIA to other city transportation.
296,PAN HANDLERS AND HOMELESS LIVING UNDER PASSES OR VACANT LOTS. TIRED OF SMELLING URINE AND SEEING DRUNK PEOPLE YELLING PROFANITIES.
297,Please do your best to keep up with growth on the roads and highways.
298,"The rapidly increasing homeless population and all its associated problems(public camping, rising crime, lack of drug addiction services, insufficient mental health resources, code violation enforcement conflicts) are a huge detractor to tax-paying residents, the business community and tourism. We do not want to be the next Seattle or San Francisco. Please learn from their policy mistakes. Do better."
299,Create an affordable housing purchase opportunity for young families just starting out.  Preserve our older neighborhoods by limiting or restricting gentrification actions. The charm of old Austin is fast disappearing and changing us into just another Dallas or Houston.
300,Obviously the city is growing at a very rapid pace.  I would like for it to remain a city people want to come to for generations.  Preserving the natural resources in the middle of growth is going to help keep that true.
301,"STOP putting the needs of illegals, homeless and liberal policies and blind agendas ahead of the population that works hard every day to struggle to pay to live here!"
302,Please make Austin more affordable by using market-based principles that have shown to work for other local governments.
303,IMPROVE TRAFFIC FLOW. OTHERWISE WE LOVE LIVING IN AUSTIN AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE HERE.
304,I can no longer afford to live in Austin. I am sad.
305,PROPERTY TAXES ARE TOO HIGH TO LIVE IN AUSTIN IF YOU ARE POOR.
306,TRY TO GET THE CITY COUNCIL TO BE IN THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM RATHER THAN ON THE FAR LEFT OR RIGHT.
307,Higher pressure on new employers coming here to support affordable housing programs.
308,WORK ON THE HOMELESS ISSUES.
309,Lower taxes and spend taxes on streets and highway infrastructure.
310,MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ROUTES AND TIMING OF BUSES.
311,"Please do not allow camping under Mopac, it is dangerous and dirty."
312,"Homeless must be address quickly, as the quality of life in Austin is rapidly declining."
313,I think that if someone calls in asking for help with speeders on their neighborhood street and ask for road hump or something to stop them that it should be done right away and not told to get a petition with signatures of neighbors who agree and then come up with the money for them. The city should just do this.
314,Stop building high rise buildings. Austin is losing its sky.
315,Give tax payers more of your attention instead of people who choose to live on the streets and have their hands out begging all of us who worked hard all our lives to have what we have.
316,"Dealing with the homeless is not and easy problem to have. Mental illness and drug addiction is a horrible thing. There are no easy answers to this problem, but having them live and camp on our streets and under bridges make Austin look and feel like a dirty place to live. Maybe the tolls that are collected for the roads that we have already been taxed on (183 at Ed Bluestien) could be used to get them the help and housing that is needed."
317,I WISH YOU HAD DONE MORE RESEARCH BEFORE CHANGING CITY ORDINANCES ON HOMELESSNESS.
318,Rescind the homeless camping ordice in Austin.
319,"Clean up downtown and outer lying areas that have homeless and trash, it is out of hand."
320,Policies need to reflect the values of our community. Inclusion is an important value.
321,The homeless situation is out of control.
322,The biggest issue in the city right now is the traffic.
323,Provide better access to and respect from city hall regarding massive development plans
324,Rid homeless around the city move them and not permit more homeless come to Austin
325,Property taxes are driving us out.  Austin Energy should be run like a business and not used to fund other city services.
326,STOP BRINGING NEW TOURIST EVENTS TO AUSTIN BECAUSE IT IS DECREASING YOUR CITIZENS' QUALITY OF LIFE
327,Stop the madness of allowing homeless to destroy the City.
328,Add at least one streetlight on opposite side if street on blocks please.
329,311 IS SUPER HELPFUL AND IS A GREAT WAY TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS FEEL THE CITY IS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM
330,Slow down growth. Austin is becoming too large and crowded.
331,"It is very important the city develop and change as an emergency traffic necessities. You need to make use of the High Way 45 for heavy traffic as the trailers, 18 wheels etc. that make impossible to move in the city, or make other ways of transportation as use of the train, highways above in downtown or more lines. Stop the immigration of other people in our city, they are destroying our city and impossible to live with all the cost of living here."
332,Leave the middle lanes on Anderson and Burnet in place. Stop with all the bike lanes on major roads like Burnet and Lamar where very few people use them.  I see just maybe 2 bikes a day using these bike lanes that are dangerous for us all.
333,"HOMELESSNESS, MORE LOW INCOME HOUSING. PROPERTY TAX STARTED AT 700 A YEAR, NOW IT IS 6000 A YEAR."
334,CLEAN UP THE HOMELESS MESS AND KEEP THEM OUT OF NEIGHBORHOODS.
335,"remember the baseball movie  ""Field of Dreams' where the narrator says  ""If they build it, they will come""? It seems to me like the city powers believe strongly in this adage.
we are already  ""to big for our britches"" and if we continue to sacrifice quality of life for growth-everyone suffers-including our formerly pristine environment.
please consider a moratorium on things that promote growth ( corporate incentives) and concentrate more on  establishing proper infrastructure  first"
336,Work vigorously on fixing traffic problems. This one thing is making Austin a less desirable town in which to live. Stop the lengthy traffic studies and get on with the work.
337,Put a real plan in place to resolve Austin's traffic issues and fix the homeless issue (starting by rescinding the recent ordice change).  The answer to the homelessness issue is NOT to let them build their own homes on public property.  It is just crazy.
338,Transportation and affordability (driven heavily by outside investment money) is making Austin less enjoyable every year.  The city does great work to make Austin a good place to live but unsustainable growth is driving away all of the creative elements that made Austin  to begin with. Please try to do whatever you can to ensure Austin retains its character and doesn't become just another boring concrete wasteland of AMLI apartment complexes and TGI Friday's.
339,Stay out of politics and manage the city. I don't want to know your party affiliation or who you support for other public office. Focus Austin Tx.
340,"Thank you, please keep fighting for mixed use, the missing middle in housing, and alternative transportation options!"
341,The ability to afford to live in central Austin is NOT only an East Austin issue.  We MUST figure out a way to make it easier for folks who bought their homes DECADES AGO to be able to continue to stay in them in them!
342,The Budget! Austin has the highest spending in the state of Texas!
343,"make the city safer - discourage homeless and drug users to leave city
reduce the number of events and festivals brings more traffic, crime and drugs to our city"
344,Please help get the homeless off every street corner. It is not safe and a dangerous distraction to drivers.
345,Please stop imitating San Fran and take care of your tax paying residents.  We are moving 100% in the WRONG direction right now with your policies.
346,Get back to the fundamentals of cost effective City services and get that right first.
347,"AISD is the worst part about living in Austin. Figure out how to fix it, because the AISD board is too incompetent to do so."
348,"The homeless situation and tent cities cropping up needs to be repaired. A) we know the root cause of the majority of homelessness is a breakdown in the support or family system. There are programs available to help these individuals. B) It's not acceptable for us to accept humans living on the streets of Austin. We should expect more of ourselves and Austin as a community to allow this to happen. We have programs and communities that work, such as Mobile Leaves and Fishes and Community First!"
349,"Budget for police, fire and EMS.  Get rid of bike lanes. Stop building new buildings and sell or rent out the ones that are already there. Try to cut down on drug use in the city. DO NOT legalize pot. Thank you"
350,"Make the arts a higher priority. Please do something about roadway construction so we can get to our museums, parks, libraries and workplaces."
351,Stop wasting our hard earned money
352,Work on solving the homeless situation by building low income housing. Quit focusing on programs that don't help the citizens of Austin.
353,Too much emphasis on growth.
354,"Austin is a lovely city with so many opportunities, but traffic issues prevent many of us from enjoying those opportunities."
355,"Implement programs to either incentivize cleaning up or increasing public waste staff to address the trash problem created by the homeless and their ""camping."""
356,This homeless thing . . . what were you thinking?
357,"I applaud Mr. Adler's courage in re-examining the homeless camping ordice. I do not want homeless people to be arrested for vagrancy, nevertheless allowing them to camp anywhere is a threat TO THEIR OWN SAFETY and to the safety of the other citizens of Austin.

I feel that a task force must be created immediately to plan for an increase in homelessness. The homeless policies of Nashville, Columbus and Salt Lake City and other middle sized cities could perhaps help for us to plan and act.

Austin has a 'we vs they' attitude problem. I actually heard someone say this at Barton Springs, ""Where were you while I was here trying to solve the problem? In California?"" That may be an interesting question, but ultimately it is non-productive. They are here now. We live here together, now. Austin is proud of being compared to Silicon Valley, but we must get over the chip on our shoulder or we will look exactly like San Francisco. Nobody wants that!"
358,stop meddling
359,"My biggest complaints are the woefully inadequate road improvements needed to keep up with city growth, the lack of affordable parking downtown and poor public transportation options. The current online options for city services are embarrassing for a tech city. And the skyrocketing costs of housing and property taxes which have pushed many of my friends out of Austin. Especially musicians which is seriously affecting our claim to the Live Music Capital."
360,Please remember what is critical to maintain Austin as a sustainable place to live. Please be cognizant that Austin is in a critical growth stage and any missteps that you make right now will impact Austin permanently. Austin must not loss its sense of self or of place. Austin is counting on you. Rise to the challenge. Break free of bureaucracy. Lead with a rebel's heart. Be radical. Radical in thinking and radical in action. Uphold the pillars of what has always made Austin amazing. That's what we all want.
361,Hi Steve. Great work.
362,Tired of all the homeless you refuse to deal with in any meaningful way.
363,"Clean up sixth street, which includes the homeless there, the drug selling and the tourists drinking and driving after partying."
364,AUSTIN HAS TO HAVE A LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM TO SOLVE TRAFFIC PROBLEM.
365,"I live in the Austin City limits, but don't feel I am part of Austin or welcomed any longer.  Mobility and access to areas is so restrictive due to traffic and events (that serve others) that prefer to stay away from downtown areas, central library and the town lake (Lady Bird) parks and trails.  Real fairness and equality issue at play here.  Should already be a major inter-connected light rail network in-place for a city this size with restricted geography and size of existing streets."
366,SLOW DOWN THE RAPID GROWTH IN EAST AUSTIN.  Growth is okay but it is being forced down our throats.
367,The city needs it's own public transportation system cap metro has failed us for decades and their plans for the future are bleak.
368,I AM GETTING TAXED OUT OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND I DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION.
369,"The city services I have used seem adequate, but East Austin is severely neglected. There aren't as many parks, libraries, etc. Access to emergency services takes longer. The landscaping is not attended as frequently. There are less grocery stores and restaurants. The traffic all over the city is terrible and keeps getting worse."
370,Encourage pay increases for teachers & first responders. Decrease pay for government officials.
371,Hold developers accountable for making the neighborhoods they build in more livable and walkable.
372,Remove the homeless center from downtown Austin
373,"Raising a family in Austin is super difficult in this city. Our mortgage is way more of our combined income than is recommended by ficial experts, but we love the city and for now, we will scrape by and endure the chronic ficial stress in order to stay in the city my husband and I were raised in. Our family support network in Austin and it would be difficult to leave in that regard."
374,"DONT USE MY TAX DOLLARS TO SUPPORT A SANCTUARY CITY STATUS. INSTEAD FUND THE US CITIZENS THAT ARE HOMELESS, NOT ILLEGAL ALIENS."
375,Don't take rights away from home owners -- urban density is NOT a fix-all for our problems.
376,"Downtown is becoming a urine-soaked homeless camp, and that is spreading across the city.  Most overpasses in the city look like homeless camps, and there seems to be a panhandler at almost every traffic light.  I've stopped visiting major cities in California because they have gotten so disgusting, and seldom go downtown at night now for the same reason.  I am sympathetic to the plight of the homeless and am fully supportive of providing shelters to help them get cleaned up and off the streets.  But we have gone too far in allowing downtown to get overrun, just like San Francisco, San Jose, etc.  Eventually, people will no longer feel safe to go downtown, or the urine and feces will drive them away.  The City needs to develop a spine and take measures to make it less attractive to camp out in our once-beautiful downtown.  Eventually, the move to drive more dense urban population downtown will reverse and people will move out of downtown if they don't feel comfortable walking on the sidewalks in front of their buildings."
377,PROLIFERATION OF SHORT TERM RENTALS
378,Find ways to help the entire community not just the rich and poor
379,MENTAL SERVICES
380,"I love Austin!!! The only major issue I have with the city is with public transportation and traffic flow, though some issues with traffic flow seem to be being worked on."
381,TAXES ARE TOO HIGH
382,"PUT MORE MONEY INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, REDUCE CONGESTION, POLLUTION."
383,PLEASE WORK ON MAKING HOUSING AFFORDABLE. AND LIVABLE WAGES SO MY CHILDREN IN THEIR 30'S DON'T HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF AUSTIN WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN
384,FIX ROADS/BRIDGES-DO SOMETHING ABOUT GETTING THE HOMELESS OUT OF THE CITY WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MONEY ON HOUSING FOR THEM. THAT WILL NOT WORK! GET RID OF THE BIKE LANES-ITS DIFFICULT FOR TRAFFIC WHEN ROADS ARE REDUCED FOR BIKE LANES. PICK UP YARD TRIMMINGS ON TIME.
385,MANAGING GROWTH IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL CITIZENS
386,PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO HELP TRAFFIC
387,TACKLE THE HOMELESS PROBLEM
388,DO NOT OFFER BIG INCENTIVES TO MAJOR COMPANIES TO LOCATE HERE.
389,KEEP DEVELOPERS FROM DESTROYING OUR CITY BY DRIVING UP OUR PROPERTY TAX.
390,LESS TAXES
391,"I immigrated to Austin from another country legally!  It was difficult.  Please do not make Austin a sanctuary city.  As difficult as it was, it was worth the wait.  Be supportive of (legal) immigration."
392,MORE PROACTIVE THINKING AND ACTION FOR CITY GROWTH. LOWER PROPERTY TAX.
393,Make Austin more affordable.
394,Provide more support for low income population.
395,"SLOW DEVELOPMENT DOWN, STOP INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES TO RELOCATE HERE."

397,Austin is a great place to live - keep it that way.
398,"Need to invest in mass transit, not cars."
399,please no more improvements to draw new people to town.
400,Police force is racist. Property tax is too high. Roads are bad.
401,"Do not allow homeless people to camp in public spaces. Please, that was the worst idea ever."
402,Concerns about diversity and cost of living
403,MORE SIDEWALKS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.
404,I THINK MAYOR ADLER IS A DECENT MAN AND DOES HIS BEST FOR HIS CONSTITUENCY. HOWEVER I THINK THE OVERALL TONE AND TEMPER OF THE CITY IS TO CREATE A CITY THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GOALS OF THE MAJORITY.
405,"More off leash dog areas.  Light at Lamar and 45th will not let you turn west when northbound unless a green arrow, waste of time to sit there."
406,FOCUS ON HOMELESS POPULATION
407,Transportation and affordability are the two most important issues facing us. Both issues have reached a crisis point where poor handling could kill the local economic dream. Affordability cannot be addressed long-term by bond-supported subsidy programs.  It must be addressed through transportation improvements and tax reduction.
408,THE DISAPPOINTMENT I HAVE THAT OUR STREETS ARE FILLED WITH HOMELESSNESS AND TENTS UNDER BRIDGES AND THE PANHANDLING THAT COMES WITH IT. AUSTIN IS TURNING INTO SAN FRANCISCO WITH NEEDLES AND POOP ON THE STREET.
409,We need better mass transit.
410,WHAT DOES THE CITY FOR THE FUTURE IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS?
411,KEEP AUSTIN AFFORDABLE
412,Homelessness/transients
413,Continue to make people feel welcome regardless of what Governor Abbott says.  I would like our island of blue to grow in the sea of red.
414,FOCUS ON BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE
415,"You have a hard job, keep pushing forward!"
416,LET'S IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSIT

421,HIGHWAY SYSTEM ARE VERY INADEQUATE
422,WE NEED A TRANSPORTATION PLAN FOR 20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE.
423,"The homeless, lawn care, security at night."
424,Address mobility (traffic/public transportation)!
425,"Strive for efficiency, reduce spending, reduce taxes."
426,"WHEN YOU EXPAND OR WIDEN A FREEWAY ADD TWO LANES, NOT ONE! PLAN LONG TERM."
427,Get the homeless off our streets. They are trashing our city that was once the most beautiful city in Texas.
428,LET'S FUND AND BUILD A STATE OF THE ART LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM.

443,Don't even suggest I should allow a homeless person camp in my neighborhood. The Mayor is way to far left on the homeless support a beggar issue. He will  not have my vote for any future election.
444,PROPERTY TAXES TOO HIGH
445,"Continue efforts to take homeless off the streets through advances in very affordable housing, cheap public transportation and jobs."
446,Please limit useless bicycle lanes where they mess with the traffic!
447,TAX RELIEF
448,"ADD MORE SIDEWALKS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS, SLOW TRAFFIC THROUGH RESIDENTIAL AREAS (78757) AND PAVE N LAMAR BETWEEN 45TH ST & 183"
449,Stop increasing the property taxes!
450,"Lack of communication, false information from public works employees. Poor quality you of work that you do.  Avoidance of issues is alarming and disappointing."
451,"PLEASE STOP BUILDING NEW TOLL ROADS. THESE ROADS ARE NOT WORKING TO REDUCE TRAFFIC. WE NEED MORE MAJOR ROADS, BUT WHEN THEY HAVE TOLLS ON THEM, A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF DRIVERS WON'T USE THEM AND THEY ARE OFTEN EMPTY, WHICH IS A WASTE OF THE RESOURCES USED FOR THOSE ROADS."
452,"We can't do everything we would like, so watch the budget."
453,OUTSIDE AUDIT
454,Control the panhandler epidemic.  Make it illegal to give money to panhandlers.  They need to move on with their live.  People enable them to be stuck by giving money.
455,Stop encouraging homelessness!

466,LAND TAX HAS TRIPLED SINCE BUYINT.
467,HOMELESS PROBLEM GETTING WORSE IT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.
468,AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PUBLIC TRANSIT
469,DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ARCH.
470,"Stop spending my money.  Your battle cry to make Austin affordable is a joke.  Austin will never be affordable if you keep raising our taxes.  Now that I am retired, I am seriously considering selling my house and moving out of Austin.  I will gladly take my tax dollars somewhere else."
471,"Let AUSTIN ,Tx be AUSTIN ,Tx not  AUSTIN, California"

485,Better mass transportation(rail and train) from south Austin to North Austin or surrounding cities North or South.

488,Fix the transportation problem.
489,DECONGEST THE ROADS
490,Please add shade to public park playscapes. They are unusable in the summer without shade.
491,"RESOLVE THE CAMPING PROBLEM of the unhoused - the streets and underpasses are filthy, smelly, unsafe and a blight"
492,Austin is a special city.  Please continue to preserve and improve what we have like Barton Springs and fight to preserve what we have with our Edwards recharge zones.
493,DON'T LET UP ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESS ISSUES!

501,"East Austin needs more north/south roads crossing the river and the greenbelt between William cannon and stassney, east of 35. Pleasant valley can't handle it all."
502,"Fix the out-of-control homeless problem in the downtown area of risk losing the Austin music and tourism industry! Stop talking, stop the phony promises and fix the problem."
503,STOP ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO MOVE HERE!  AND STOP TEARING DOWN ICONIC AUSTIN INSTITUTIONS LIKE THREADGILLS!  START RESPECTING LONG TERM RESIDENTS!  WE DO NOT WANT MORE CONDOS AND MORE DENSITY!  WE DO NOT WANT MORE FESTIVALS!
504,All interactions I have had moving to Austin with government employees has been excellent. My only problem with Austin is that employees will not hire older workers.
505,Try to improve traffic on Brodie between Slaughter and 1626.
506,Musicians USED to be able to make a living to afford to live here...we should figure out a way to make that possible for them again.
507,"Austin is a wonderful place to live for me and my family, but we want to be sure it remains that way and also to extend that sense of welcome and inclusion to others. Make sure our city is welcoming to all races and income levels. Be welcoming to immigrants. Let's be a city that is not just known for our music festivals, but also for our efforts to build an inclusive, welcoming, sustainable community for everyone who chooses to live here."
508,"Get the traffic under control, especially on MOPAC."
509,"You know what city department is well run?  ABIA.  They have a vision, they don't spend a lot of time to debate it, they execute.  
We are the fast growing large city in the US and acting like a podunk backwater college town that we were in 1968 - just stop.  
That kind of endless dickering doesn't solve problems - it's can kicking and every year the problems get worse. . .and worse. . .and worse.
And you know what - one of these days we're going to get into a pickle where we just don't have the resources to solve it any more.   Our economic success is masquerading a huge problem - but we won't have that forever.  When we do hit a hiccup it's going to be very  painful for all.  
We could fix it now, when we have the resources and energy that come from this tremendous growth.  We use that to our advantage, or we get run over by it."
510,Traffic congestion
511,"Austin is doing an amazing job with its animal services . The no-kill initiative has been so successful. Please keep it up! 
Improvements to I-35, especially between slaughter lane and downtown , are desperately needed ."
512,"This survey should have been administered online. Paper, postage, etc. wasteful! Why do you hate the environment?"
513,"We need to quit wasting money on Code Next consultants, trips to the border for problems that aren't in your jurisdiction and make the city efficient. You need to find ways to cut spending and stop wasting. My property taxes are over $1,000 per month for 1 person.  How would someone be able to retire when you raise taxes every year regardless of the ability to pay?"
514,"Austin is turning into cement city! I live within the city limits and more and more of what little GREENBELTS that we had are being torn down and more office buildings, apartments and condos are taking over everywhere."
515,The city has to become more affordable for everyone. Even middle class people like my husband and I will have to move in order to accomplish our goals in life.
516,"Quit giving away freebies because you think it is cool to have in Austin. Also, worry about Austin residents and not state and federal issues (immigration on border)."
517,Please keep the growth in check.  We are beginning to look like a sprawling Los Angeles.  :(
518,"Try and do things the Texas way, not the California way."
519,"Austin has been good to me and my family over the past 25 years.  Growth is exciting, but my neighbors and I share concerns about a loss in the quality of life due to the growth.  Improved, smart, greatly expanded public transportation options and policies that help people live in and stay in the City are critical to keeping Austin livable.  As property values sky-rocket, that again is exciting.  But those of us who do not want to cash out and leave are being pressured by high taxes.  And one by one, we watch our neighbors move out of the neighborhood replaced by investors who will never lay eyes on their investment much less become a part of the neighborhood.  Change is hard.  But people and quality of life  spurs Austin's growth too.  I sometimes worry that the City is more concerned about attracting big business here than about keeping us here."
520,I want to stay within the city and would love assistance on home buying that I qualify for with my income. I've been attempting however at this moment what I qualify for isn't exactly how I would like to live or they get taken by investors at cash or someone who can offer more than I can. I love being here in Austin and want to raise my son here as well Simply need better resources
521,That we need better highway roads or over access highway for better traffic control.
522,"I know the voters make it really hard by rejecting the various proposals on the ballot, but traffic and transportation really is becoming a nightmare here in Austin. I'm fortunate to live close to work, but I actively avoid driving to the north side of the city unless absolutely necessary because traffic has become so bad. And yes, the bus system is an option, but it is very slow and adds significant time to my travel."
523,Affordability is KILLING our Creative Class. Something MUST be done or we will become another DFW.
524,I hope you are voted out in the next election.
525,GET ALL THIS GODDAMN ROAD CONSTRUCTION......MOVING!! 35s been messed up since BEFORE I moved here 10 freaking years ago!

528,Make property taxes cheaper for Senior Citizens receiving only Social Security income.
529,Wish there would be better education of residents on services offered by the city.
530,"Stop wasting tax dollars on non-essential city services, focus on fixing the most pressing problems of the city,  stop taxing and spending like liberals, and make city government more fiscally transparent.  I'm also amazed that there was not a single question about schools (unless they are after this question)."
531,"Get ahead of infrastructure growth even if that makes people upset,  commute times are insane"
532,"VERY DISSATISFIED. VOTED FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WILL NOT IN THE COMING ELECTIONS. WHAT THEY STATED THEY WERE GOING TO DO HAVE NOT BEEN FULFILLED. THEY HAVE LIED ON LOWERING PROPERTY TAXERS AND COST OF LIVING AND MAKING IT AFFORDABLE. THEY GIVE TAX BREAKS TO LARGE CORPORATIONS AND COST BREAKS ON UTILITIES, FREE HOUSING . HOME TAXES HAVE SKY ROCKETED AS WELL AS UTILITIES. AUSTINITES ARE BEING PUSHED OUT. MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES AND SENIORS LOSE THEIR HOMES. MAYOR AND COUNCIL NO ACCOUNTABILITY ON HANDLING CITY FUNDS.

553,ADDRESS THE BURDEN OF PROPERTY TAX ON FIXED INCOME. FIND A BETTER FOR SOLUTION FOR TRAFFIC PROBLEMS.
554,"It's become a city for the rich and it didn't used to be this way.  We would move to the small city's nearby because of traffic and affordability, but our children and medical care keep us here."
555,"I'm not a tea party activist and believe taxes are needed for city services, but I am curious why Austin has higher effective tax rates than either Houston or Dallas, which dwarf Austin in size."
556,Keep walking areas for children clear of debris.
557,"Concern with public transportation, poor options."
558,"Visit France and see how they save energy, also parking on the streets and go paperless."
559,Start working on a subway.
560,Work harder for healthcare.

574,"WE NEED SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION ,ENERGY AND PRACTICES IN PLACE TO SUPPORT AUSTIN FOR THE GREATER GOOD."
575,More recycling resources for cartons and other items not accepted at recycling center currently.  Expand I-35.  More low income housing.

Th streets are and drainage system is  need of major repairs, water sits on streets and dose not drain, the access to my home street is dangerous, there is no money or time spent to update the roads and signage on Ledesma from Spring Dale to Terry Dr. New homes are built everyday and no improvement to the roads or infrastructure are made. taxes are paid and no update to my hood. very disappointing"
577,"Please move the homeless shelter outside downtown area, kills the buzz of people wanting to come visit and diminishes tourism."
578,"PALACE PKWY AT DITTMAR NEEDS SPEED BUMPS ON STREET, CARE GO SO FASE, ITS UNSAFE FOR PARKED CARS AND PEOPLE CAUSE CARS GO FAST ALONG PALACE PKWY  THANK YOU"
579,PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRAFFIC. TOO MUCH DEVELOPMENT NOT ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE.STOP WITH THE HORRIBLE BLACK PAVING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS CHEAP AND UNSAFE.
580,"Listen to the working, tax paying citizens."
581,traffic is a problem but it'll take time and money to keep up with the fast population increase
582,Traffic congestion and lack of quality/professional transit options is unacceptable if you continue to allow development structures in the city - work with surrounding counties/cities to deliver best for all transportation/roads/hwy use.
583,DO SOMETHING About traffic
584,Fix the homeless problem.  Get them out of the middle of the streets and street corners begging!
585,Affordability and property taxes are too high. Do not give new businesses tax incentives that cause home owners to pay so much. We won't be able to afford to live here. Fix transportation issues. No development without transportation options first.
586,THE CITY NEEDS MORE SIDEWALKS AND BETTER CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
587,STOP BEING A SANCTUARY CITY!
588,WORK ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVE TRAFFIC
589,"It's time to realize that Austin is a great place to live but if we continue to grow at the pace predicted the city infrastructure and transit systems will need to be expanded.  Austin, unfortunately, is getting bigger so we need to figure out how to manage and plan for that growth now not in 5 or 10 years when it is too late.  We need to expand on what made Austin what it is today and not lose that through the growing pains. I get to travel all over this country for work and I can live anywhere but I choose to live here for the people, community, and uniqueness that is Austin.  Don't lose sight of that."

597,"Make Capital Metro train: (1) More frequent, every 20 or 30 minutes. (2) Longer hours, especially on weekends, (last train @ 2 AM). (3) Add more stops SOUTH (e.g. One at South Congress and another at South Lamar). We don't need more stops further north!"
598,"Living wages, if the people legally here can not afford to live here, what does that say about the wonderful city Austin in the great state of Texas?"
599,"Fix our streets, more access to north and south Austin. Fix I 35 through downtown!!"
600,"Please do something about the increasing number of homeless panhandlers, clean up for this population is absent."

613,AUSTIN NEEDS TO INCREASE EDUCATION STANDARDS ACROSS THE CITY.
614,The city needs more public transportation!!  The traffic on roads has gotten much worse through the years.
615,"Focus on the essentials - water, safety, housing.  Very critical in our current rate of growth."
616,Run city government like a business.  Make city employees and officials accountable for their performance.  Let the out-of-the-box ideas be given consideration.
617,"All Austin residents deserve safety, cultural enrichment, food and housing security and confidence that they will enjoy equal rights and protection.  We have improved as a city over the last few decades, but we have not always ensured equality of opportunity or well managed growth.  This is a great city - thanks for reaching out and asking people about their perceptions and goals."
618,DON'T LET DIVERSITY SAIL OUT OF YOUR TEAM.
619,WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO INVEST IN EXPANDED PUBLIC TRANSIT IN A WAY THAT WE CAN AGREE TO REDUCE TRAFFIC AND MAKE DOWNTOWN MORE ACCESSIBLE. NEED MORE SERVICES FOR HOMELESS.
620,WOULD PREFER TO WORK TOWARDS LOWER TAXES
621,MORE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
622,STOP GENTRIFICATION
623,"PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION , TRAFFIC CONTROL."
624,ADDRESS ISSUES OUTSIDE DOWNTOWN CITY CORE AREA
625,I SEE INCREASED DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT SAME LEVEL OF WERVICES. COST OF LIVING IS INCREASING WHILE SALARIES ARE NOT.
626,fix the william cannon 290 intersection please
627,"I MAKE A GOOD SALARY, YET I AM UNABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE/TOWNHOUSE/CONDO IN AUSTIN BECAUSE IT IS SO EXPENSIVE. PROPERTY TAXES ARE OUTRAGEOUS. AUSTIN IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE AND TRAFFIC IS BAD-DO SOMETHING."
628,"Always put the interests of the most vulnerable people first. Live to serve, not to lead."
629,TRAFFIC
630,QUIT CHOOSING A SIDE FOR VOTES
631,"PUBLIC LIGHT RAIL/CITY TRAIN TO IMPROVE WALKABILITY--LOOK AT HOW THEY DO IT IN BROOKLYN WHERE ALL NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WALKABLE AND PEOPLE CONGREGATE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS AT LOCAL BUSINESSES, PARKS, COFFEE SHOPS. LET'S DO THAT IN ATX AND SHOW TEXAS HOW ITS DONE."
632,We need a world class museum.
633,Negotiate a fair contract w/apd and get more cops on patrol. Safety is #1 and the Mayor and council seem not to care. Crime is on the rise because there is no police presence.
634,Need to plan for growth but do not do at the expense of our original downtown neighborhoods the provide housing for families & some of our older & retired residents.
635,"Education needs improvements. Traffic, high rent. My daughter goes to a school rated 1 out of 10 where are my taxes dollars going."
636,"THE HOMELESS LIVING HERE UNDER BRIDGE 183 IS OUT OF CONTROL, CAN NOT STOP WITHOUT BEING CONFRONTED, SHAME, FILTHY CONDITIONS TO WTINESS, DALLAS DOES NOT ALLOW WHATS HAPPENING TOSTATE CAPTIAL AUSTIN"
637,"DIFFERENT SERVICES TO GET AROUND AUSTIN GROCERY SERVICE FOR ELDERLY, NOT JUST ROUTINE VALUES"
638,homeless/panhandling
639,PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED HERE THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND WOULD RATHER LEAVE THAN HAVE TO MOVE TO A POORER PART OF AUSTIN
640,WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE MAYOR ADLER
641,"PLEASE LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, LIGHT RAIL SYSTEMS, SELF DRIVING CARS."
642,"Stop spending money on bike lanes - it's ruining transportation because bicycles don't obey traffic laws. We do not need a soccer team - with any hope, the current mayor will be gone soon after the next election."
643,"There are only 2 ""gender identities"". Small Business owner and self employed were left off as an option but that isn't surprising seeing as the Mayor seems to be at war with us just like the obama administration was. Cut the liberal garbage and get the business done. Stop blowing money on diversity and trying to make Austin more affordable or inclusive because spending money on nonsense just makes it more unaffordable for everyone. Get to work you bums and focus on what matters instead of pandering to your voting base."
644,"Our low income neighborhood doesn't get the attention of upkeep of sidewalks, low hanging limbs over sidewalks, loud music and partying of neighbors (too often) after 11:00 pm."
645,THE AIRPORT IS TERRIBLE.
646,I'd like to see the city do what it can to push back against the Trump Administration's immigration policies and foster an environment that treats people justly but also humanely and with compassion.
647,Traffic. Street light timings. Add Metered on-ramp to Highway 5.
648,"Imagine Austin in 20 years - 2338, without bold, transformational choices about congestion, cultural attractions, and job diversity, ATX will be all condos and bars. Time to put some 200-year steaks in the ground to make sure Austin has some history to lean on. Let's get a museum district going. Let's support ethnic enclaves that give Austin unique points of view. Let's have teacher's able to live in the city limits and for gosh sake, bring back ""Auditorium Shores""."
649,Open all pools in the summer.
650,Transparency
651,Clamp down on homeless people turning Austin into a (terrible place.)
652,"Stop raising taxes to subsidize political causes, and wasting resources on stupid things like trying to change the city name."
653,More trains - less toll roads.
654,"We need  better cost of living $1600 + for a 2 bedroom apt really, and 2 people working 2 jobs to make ends meet and still live pay check to paycheck... 30 min to get out of downtown from The capital to Riverside, really. Better traffic system to get people in and out Look at Las Vegas for ideas...they have a great system...when making new subdivisions, improve the roads to get the new residence and older ones in and out of the area, don't leave one lane for a subdivision of 365+ houses and expect that the traffic is going to flow so great...Look to larger cities on loops around the city for traffic flow.  Do not just spend more money on the more rich side to have better roads then those on the south or east side..."
655,"ECOURAGE TRANSPARENCY, EFFICIENCY AUDITS, MAINTAINING OUR NEIGHBORHODD AND POOLS"
656,"continue working on fastening a sense of community here in Austin, we want this city to feel like a family where everyone respects, cares for, and loo0ks out for on another"
657,"Expand trains, extensively. Build bypass for I-35, 71, 183. Do better with preserving the east code and avoiding gentrification. Work to reduce traffic and vehicular reliance/dependence."
658,"Focus on Austinites. It is hard to keep up with the increasing cost of living in Austin. Having a bond to help low income people increases the taxes and impacts current resident low income people. Also, the train is a mess. Does anyone pay to ride? No one ever checks for a ticket. There are so many people standing, someone is going to get hurt and sue the city."
659,"Invest more in transportation, mobility and thoughtful development to ease congestion. Support sustainable grown to preserve Austin's character."
660,stop subsidizing city govt with high elec/water rates

663,Traffic
664,ROLL BACK PROPERTY TAXES FOR HOMEOWNERS OVER 65
665,FIX THE TRAFFIC. STOP BUILDING TOLL ROADS
666,Highway development
667,INCREMENTAL CHANGES AND GRAND BARGAINS WITH DEVELOPERS AND LANDLORDS WILL NEVER STEM THE TIDE OF GENTRIFICATION. WE HAVE TO SHIFT POWER TO WORKING PEOPLE AND TENANTS.
668,"Fix the traffic situation on I-35, Mopac, 290 and other major roads.  Toll roads are not the solution.  Also, small ""construction"" fixes along these major roads won't work.  By the time construction is done, the city growth will have already outgrown the ""new"" road.  One solution would be an affordable rail system along I-35, Mopac, 183 and Ben White with park and ride locations along the route."
669,we need to solve the traffic/transportation problems plaguing this city
670,Need more affordable housing.
671,"Quit trying to change this city into a bastion for homeless people.
Fix our traffic problems
Stop spending money on worthless projects."
672,"Austin has been home for a long time. It is a great place to bring up a family, outside of the summer heat and allergy seasons."
673,"I want this city to be diverse, affordable, and accessible for middle class families. There are a lot of cool things in the city I don't take advantage of because it's too much effort and time to drive downtown and park."
674,"Austin's ready for change. Share a bold vision and we'll get behind the Mayor and City Council. Be transparent about the trade-offs we'll make as a community and the consequences for not seizing this moment. You weren't elected to lead Austin in the '60s or the '80s; you were elected now and we need leadership more than ever. Change is the only constant. We either find a way to gracefully grow this city, helping as many residents benefit from that growth as possible, or someone else - big developers, big corporations, etc. - will impose their vision on us during a moment of disunion and weakness."
675,KEEP MOVING FORWARD ON CLIMATE CHANGE
676,Help make transportation options more comprehensive - y'all have done a good job with buses and biking/walking corridors.  Keep at it!
677,CITY PLANNING NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.
678,INVEST IN A DART LIKE LIGHT RAIN THAT IS VIABLE
679,Build more non toll roads.
680,east river dr needs repaved and construction areas need better street clearing crews to prevent so many flat tires and car issues   thank you
681,Stronger math and literacy  programs in schools.
682,"Make it more affordable for working people.  The people that pay your taxes and salary.  Fix traffic issues.  Stop making our city look like trash by letting homeless people camp everywhere.  Think before you take away current ordices without putting new rules in place.  Rail!!!!  Park and rides!!!  Stop leaving oak hill out of transportation plans.  Know who you represent, what they want/need and not just what you think would be good."
683,FIX JOB AND HOUSING ISSUES.
684,"The housing situation. We have a decent income, and cannot find a house close to town that is reasonable for our commutes. Housing cost is insanely expensive, even with a comfortable income."
685,"IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION, NOT THE SCOOTERS!"
686,MAKE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AFFORDABLE AND RAISE THE WORKING WAGE IN AUSTIN SO THAT WE CAN KEEP UP WITH YOUR GROWING COST! MAKE AUSTIN  BETTER NOT JUST FOR YOU BUT FOR THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOM ARE LIVING HERE AS WELL. BE HONEST AND SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING THE QUALITY OF LIFE HERE GREAT!!!!
687,CREATE HOMELESS FACILITIES LIKE THE ONES LOCATED ON BEN WHITE IN ALL DISTRICTS ASAP.
688,Do something about the homeless situation.  Stop so much building and polluting our waterways.
689,Focus on making it less expensive to live here. Stop focusing on all these stupid subjects like street renames and such that do NOTHING to improve life here but instead cost the City and businesses money to adjust.
690,Too much change is not a good thing.
691,"BE EMPATHETIC TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AS LUCKY AS YOU. LIFT PEOPLE UP-HELP FEED AND GIVE A CHANCE TO OTHERS. THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS REGARDING HOMELESSNESS, WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE"
692,Austin will lose tourists and new residents if something is not done about the homeless crisis.
693,Please realize that you are destroying a Texas community.  We are not San Francisco California.  Please take care of the residents of your community and not make us a bacon for immigrants to come here and  sleep in our parks.  Please realize that we residents are not your bank and do not have unlimited funds for you to give away.
694,WE CANNOT LET THE HOMELESS RUIN THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND BEAUTY OF AUSTIN. YOU HAVE TO CREATE A REALISTIC SOLUTION OTHERWISE MORE HOMELESS COME TO AUSTIN
695,We need more police and enforcement of traffic laws
696,Unity belongs EVERYWHERE!
697,IMPROVED MASS TRANSIT
698,TRAFFIC IS RUINING AUSTIN'S QUALITY OF LIFE.
699,"Build a city/county wide metro rail system, please, the one line is not enough, and please link it to the airport. Thank you!"
700,PRESERVE OUR HISTORY SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN FORM IT RATHER THAN BOWING TO ONE ETHNIC GROUPS WISHES.
701,RE-THINK THE SCOOTERS ON OUR STREETS.
702,Solve or lessen the problem of homelessness
703,Please re-think and work with the police in regards to the camping ordice.
704,"My same concern. Growth has caused this city to be unusable. No fun. As a retired person (although I'm a member of the Travis Co. Historical Commission) I basically just don't do anything unless forced to because of traffic, parking and crowds. It's just no fun to have to deal with the problems. THIS at a time when the cost to live here has gone up, up, up due to property tax."
705,The traffic! The city is the number 1 growing city in the US for the 8th straight year according to Forbes magazine. We cannot stop the growth. Time to embrace it. Build highways and roads that allow traffic to flow. Enough of the terrible design of an on-ramp flowing into an off-ramp and then the lane ends. Or the access roads that require you to merge over three lanes after an exit to make a right turn at the street. The design of the highways is terrible.
706,"How do we allocate some of the costs for running the City to Federal, State and County entities rather than burden non-exempt property owners with higher taxes & fees?"
707,Improve traffic flow in the city and reduce taxes
708,We don't effect change for our homeless residents by removing an ordice.  We have an out of control homelessness epidemic in our city.  What are we doing to truly get people off the streets?  What are we doing to transition people into safe housing?  Assist with addiction recovery?  With mental health services?  I'm so disappointed that the best our city has come up with is to simply decriminalize sleeping on the streets.  I'm concerned that this band aid method is only going to serve to attract the criminal transients to Austin and put us all at risk.
709,"RUN THE HOMELESS OUT OF AUSTIN, BUILD ROADS AND HIGHWAYS, A REAL LOOP. DO NOT CLOSE OLD SAN ANTONIO RD."
710,SUSTAINABILITY OF CITY
711,MORE FREE PARKING DOWNTOWN FOR PARKS AND REC
712,HOMELESS
713,"Stop giving tax incentives to businesses for coming here! We have a lot to offer and should not need to do this. More importantly, we need the tax revenue from these businesses. It's not fair to burden citizens, who may be facing gentrification that forces them out of town, with high taxes and while giving rich companies a free ride for years. In a city growing like we are and with a low unemployment rate, they don't bring us enough benefit to make that a winning deal for us if they aren't paying their share of taxes."
714,We need to preserve our inner city neighborhoods and provide more/better affordable housing options.
715,Reduce the traffic congestion.

719,"Keep up the good work in a growing, dynamic city with a complex population."
720,"Please address the homeless situation. I want to help but I'm not sure how.  Volunteering to hand out meals, etc. doesn't seem like enough. It is the homeless that create the largest fear for me to go downtown, especially in the evenings, but in some areas (7th/Neches) I don't even feel safe during the day (sadly, as I'm sure many of the residents do either). I know this is a very tall request and I'm happy to join conversations to weigh in ideas, but I do think this is a problem we must address quickly for everyone."
721,"NEIGHBORHOOD HAS NO SIDEWALKS, DRAINAGE FOR RAIN OR STOP LIGHTS"
722,TRAFFIC IS MAKING ME CONSIDER MOVING.
723,ONLY AFFORDABLE FOR THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS

726,SLOW DOWN DEVELOPMENT FOR QUALITY OF LIFE!!
727,"WE NEED GREEN, 21ST CENTURY PUBLIC TRANSIT PLAN"
728,TRANSPORTATION NIGHTMARE
729,"HELP HOMELESS SITUATION, IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY UNSAFE."
730,REMEMBER TO HELP THE HELPLESS.
731,Homeless people. I suggest you take the facilities city owns already to move these folks into safety. EX: Home Depot facility at St. Johns. It would make a great camp ground.
732,welcome the homeless to live in his yard.
733,I WISH I HAD BUS STOP BACK AT LEDESMA AND LOTT. I USED TO RIDE THE BUS TO WORK.
734,MORE PEOPLE MOVING HERE IS NOT A POSITIVE.
735,"HELP THE HOMELESS, CLEAN UP DOWNTOWN"
736,"WE NEED LIGHT RAIL, BUSES ARE UNRELIABLE AND TAKE TOO LONG."
737,Cease efforts to allow camping in public places.  Your current efforts to end homelessness will fail.  If people want to work they can find jobs.
738,"Please try to get traffic moving!  Less street lights and more highway lanes, especially at the ""Y"" intersection.  Too many people and no means to travel efficiently."
739,"Do what's right, not what's popular and trendy."
740,"THE MAYOR SHOULD NOT DO WHAT IS POPULAR, BUT WHAT IS BEST FOR ALL."
741,HIRE MORE POLICE.INSTITUTE AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN ON TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS. DRIVERS ARE BREAKING LAWS ALL OVER THE CITY AND THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CONSEQUENCE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
742,SO EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN LOCATION OF HOMELESS SHELTERS
743,Traffic
744,HOUSING OPTIONS AND DIVERSE TRANSPORTATION GO HAND-IN-HAND. WE'D LOVE TO DROP DOWN TO ONLY ONE CAR BUT WE CAN'T DO IT WITH THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
745,I DONT FEEL CONNECTED WITH AUSTIN.MY COUNCIL PERSON HAD A SATELLITE OFFICE ON ANDERSON MILL RD-DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HIM BUT I DROPPED IN TO TALKE TO HIM 2-3 TIMES. I LIKED THAT HE WAS CLOSE. THAT'S GONE NOW.
746,30 YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE PLEADED WITH THEM NOT TO TURN AUSTIN INTO A HOUSTON/DALLAS TYPE OF MEGA COMMUNITY. IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE HUGE RANGE OF ISSUES DUE TO GROWTH AT ALL COSTS. GOOD LUCK TO THEM.
747,"Please get out of downtown Austin so you can better understand how real Austinites live when it comes to mobility, congestion, affordability and the condition of roads and other city-owned property (such as medians, etc.). I'd encourage the mayor and council as a whole to take rotating ""district field trips"" where they visit a different city council district and really drive around to check it out and also talk to residents. Even with city council districts, there's an overwhelming sense that our elected city officials are elitists. No one more so than Mayor Adler, who sometimes seems not to live in the real world."
748,Stop the inflation of real estate prices. It's not about supply and demand. These prices are driven by greed.
749,Awful people who work in code enforcement. They are truly terrible

754,"Reduce the influx of those trying to change the culture of our city. This is no longer the Austin I chose to live in. When I no longer need to work full-time, I will probably move out of Austin. It costs too much to live here when our cool, weird vibe is dying so rapidly."
755,"1. QUIT PROMOTING BIKE LANES. BIKES DO NOT COVER THE MOBILITY PROBLEMS.2. QUIT TRYING TO TURN SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS INTO FOURPLEXES, ETC. CITY SHOULD NOT TAKE POSITIONS THAT WILL DESTROY HOME VALUES 3. DON'T USE CODENEXT AS A SOCIAL ENGINEERING TOOL."

758,SELL THE UTILITY!
759,PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
760,"Please don't chase trying to be like LA, Seattle, Portland or other progressive cities.  The recent homeless ordice is an example of misguided government.  You only have to look at those cities to see what Austin will become.  We have enjoyed living here and raising a family and it would be a shame to leave due to lawlessness by government (Freedom City is a good example of a city government not following laws)."
761,"Listen to the people, not the ones lining your pocketbook."
762,Please attempt to maintain the uniqueness of Austin.   This might include affordable housing for artists and musicians and other folks who may not have a high income.  Please try to keep property taxes down.  Please find a way to alleviate some of traffic.

774,BETTER ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC TRANSIT

780,Fix the homeless and affordability problem without making the working class pay for it.  More reliable public transportation.

783,The majority of residents do not live downtown.  Most obvious efforts go to support downtown and tourists.
784,"HOMELESS PROBLEM, BIKE LANES, SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES, FORCING ALL THE LGBTQ CRAP ON US!"
785,Stop with uncontrolled growth for sake of tax money.  Stop turning Austin into California!  East Austin is no longer the Austin I loved.
786,YOU ARE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE RELAXING WHAT DRUG AND ALCOHOL ORDINANCE PROTECTION WE HAD. TENTS ARE NOT COMPASSIONATE. RETURNING THESE FOLKS BACK INTO PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS IS.
787,Will you please step down and admit your failures. You have destroyed the city.
788,Lets get control of the homeless population by providing mental health evaluations and quality health care.  Mobile Loaves and Fishes along with Community First Village has a great concept and I hope to see more developments like this moving forward.
789,MAKE RENT MORE AFFORDABLE.
790,Lower property taxes.
791,Please fix the traffic.
792,Treat the City of Austin residents BETTER than you do big business.  STOP giving tax breaks and utility discounts to business and end existing relationships.  Pass the savings on to residential property tax payors.
793,Please make more affordable housing available.
794,GIVE APD THE FUNDING TO HIRE 200+ MORE OFFICERS. THIS CITY IS GROWING QUICKLY AND THE APD HAS NOT GROWN AT ALL IN MANY YEARS. ADDING 4-8 MORE OFFICERS IS NOT GOING TO HELP.
795,"FIX TRAFFIC, GET VAGRANTS OFF CITY PROPERTY"
796,housing affordability is a huge issue
797,Poor budgets and poor management
798,The property tax and the utilities need to be lowered. Retired people can no longer afford to live here. All you care about is bringing in people from other places. This city is to crowded as it is.
799,"traffic is terrible. If I was starting a business, I'd do it in Georgetown or Hutto"

805,Quit promoting only high paying business growth.
806,I am very concerned with affordability of housing.  Many people are underpaid overall and have to live with many others to meet rents.  People in service jobs are left with little resources but to live way outside the city limits.
807,"We need public transportation-like a subway-now!  Also, invest in roads, transportation is our biggest issue."
808,"Focus on what is important to people who live and work in Austin quality of life afforded to us by the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   Austin will never return to what it was once, but can be even better."

816,PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.
817,"Do everything in your power to enable the SERVICE workers in Austin a decent chance at living in the City.  I'm one myself.  We are getting priced out and, as a result, we are contributing to the traffic problems getting into town to do all service jobs all the more wealthy people need.  Thanks!"
818,Go green. We must stop unsustainable growth. So YOU must stop letting developers set the agenda.
819,try not to react in a knee-jerk fashion   there are always folks who love to stir the pot of controversy   they should be ignored at lest 75% of the time
820,"Homelessness and the trash around our city is awful. Everywhere you look you see trash on the side of the roads or people sleeping, camping, using the restroom. We need to take back our city."
821,more large parks outside downtown
822,Address the homeless population/problem now! The citizens cannot be the ones to solve the problem the city is unwilling.
823,Follow the desires of your constituents and quit faking transparency.
824,"Deal with our traffic problems in an effective manner. Help homeless people with healthcare, job training and compassion, but DO NOT let them sleep, camp or loiter in public places. Manage or electric and water systems and bring down our costs."
825,"With the experienced growth explosion and forecasted continued and aggressive growth to the city, road infrastructure is one of the most critical items of importance to the city. Affordability and confining cost of living run close seconds."
826,"Keep city vibrant, develop connection to outdoor spaces"
827,"Mayor and city council needs to start serving the average citizen, not the homeless, not the immigrants,"
828,"Stop Street people from being victims on the street.   Homeless shelters that give hope, food, and a different answer to Life
I voted for you   Do not let the home less situation define You  Solve this issue in a kind way. Please get them off the streets and give them Hope.
 I was homeless for one year in 1970 and if I had stayed on the streets I would not be here today."
829,Tolerance toward homeless is in total disregard to residents who actually invest in city
830,Do not allow development to take or tax me out of my home.
831,"Austin in no longer where I want to live. I am 4th generation and plan to leave in next year. It is too crowded, too expensive and no longer unique. Crime increasing."
832,Stand up to the developers.
833,LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSIT IN AUSTIN IS BAD FOR A CITY THAT HAS THIS AMOUNT OF GROWTH TRAFFIC. TOOL ROADS ARE NOT A SOLUTION FOR TRAFFIC ISSUES.
834,AFFORDABILITY IS A BIG PROBLEM. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS LACKING.
835,"Fix the homeless problem. Our overpasses, streets and wooded areas are an embarrassment."
836,Provide the major services. Stop imposing taxes and regulations.
837,The overall cost of living is getting out of control. The traffic is challenging and affects quality of life.
838,Quit bringing development and homeless into this City unless infrastructure is improved to handle the masses without raises our taxes.
839,Get the homeless people off the public streets - put them all in various parks downtown with a fence and provide sanitary facilities they need.  the streets and curbs are dirty enough as it is.

841,I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT OUR LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION PLANS AS THE CITY GROWS ESPECIALLY IN AUSTIN.
842,STOP MAKING TRAFFIC WORSE AND LOWER TAXES.
843,Cost of living unreasonable.
844,PLEASE FIND A SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE SF OR OREGON.

Make life affordable for anyone willing to work.

850,USE HOTEL TAX FOR METRO RAIL FROM UT DOWNTOWN TO AIRPORT.

852,STOP GOING ROGUE WITH LIBERAL AGENDAS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE STATE.
853,ADDRESS HOMELESS CAMPING LIMIT WHERE THEY CAMP ADDRESS TRAFFIC COMMUTE COST OF TOLL WAYS IN PARK TIMES TOO HIGH.
854,"city council is losing touch with the residents and focus on trying to please everyone, including those that don't really live here.  I am happy to help the homeless, but in many cases these individuals chose that lifestyle and want to live that way.  No camping in public for anyone ever."
855,WATER AFFORDABILITY TRANSPORTATION NEED TO CATCH UP TO ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT.
856,GROWING WAY TOO FAST DOESN'T SEEM WE CAN REALLY HANDLE ALL THESE PEOPLE. WE NEED TO IMPROVE SCHOOLS.

867,FAIR PROPERTY TAX INCREASES. MINE HAVE GONE UP 300% IN 6 YEARS.
868,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CITY COUNCIL'S DECISION TO LIFT THE ORDINANCES CONCERNING CAMPING/NO SIT NO LIE AND THE HOMELESS SITUATION.

871,Disagree with the last homeless issue that passed.

884,REDUCE TAXES
885,Traffic is a problem
886,"Make Austin a nice place to live for families again where we can feel safe and can enjoy the amenities the city has to offer in peace.

Please learn from San Francisco and Portland and don't ruin the city."
887,Fix our waste water bill ....they need to put a Y in for pool water and yard sprinkler system.
888,DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRAFFIC

896,Be fair to the military widows AO Taxes City had not bin fair on it
897,Stop your socialist agenda. Work for ALL the people and not just the vocal minority.
898,"It's unrealistic to expect that we can stop (or even slow) growth significantly, so let's focus on managing it to the greatest extent possible through policies that improve density of housing, improve traffic infrastructure and flow, improve public transportation options and maintain the ""culture"" of Austin that currently only exists in myth."
899,You need to listen to the Republicans.
900,"Kick out all homeless unless they want rehabilitation and get a job. Outlaw camping as it is now. Let police arrest them. Send them packing on a bus one way ticket.

902,Get the police on the roads and enforce traffic laws.
903,CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE.
904,"I'd like there to be more accountability to the people of Austin when there is an issue.

906,HOMELESS CAMPS NEED REMOVED FROM WOODED AREAS NEAR TRAILS AND THE ARCH NEEDS RELOCATED.
907,REDUCE PUBLIC TRANSIT TIME

910,"Look at cities such as Houston and Dallas for guidance on homeless solutions, NOT to San Francisco, Seattle and Portland"
911,Stop letting the homeless trash our city.
912,"The residential taxes are killing me. Recently divorced I  WILL have to move out of Austin when I retire. The taxes I pay on my home are unsustainable. I live be very frugally  and while I realized I am single living in a family home my taxes were  very high and my house was over assessed for the past 5 years. This year somehow someone must have caught it!   My 1800 sq. foot house was assessed at $100K more than other houses that are 2500 sq. ft houses on my street.  Finally, this year my house seems more in line with my neighborhood. I would love a refund for all of the money I overpaid in taxes and the lies told to me at the tax office. 
The homeless problem is absolutely ridiculous. I recently visited Seattle. We are starting to look like that. Not good    
I would like to see the city provide designated spaces for camping. Loaves and fishes is one great example for homeless people to move forward and get help while helping themselves. I believe public camping in Austin will really hurt the tourism industry in Austin."
913,"Please work toward getting our schools the funding they need to provide adequate education, services, &  trained educators to our students"
914,Change your position regarding homeless.  The citizens of Austin should NOT be responsible for them; they are invaders.  Try to remove them from the City rather than serve them.
915,Please consider the poor and working poor.  Too much is given to the rich in this city.
916,"Affordable housing.  We make over $80,000/year.  Where's my starter home?  I'm willing to rent until my father passes (hopefully that's not soon) and I inherit his home, but you need to do me a favor and cap rent.  These apartment communities say that they charge based on supply and demand, yet 1/3+ of their units sit empty.  What's the scam?  $1,150+ for a one bedroom and $1,850 for a two bedroom is not just."
917,Please try to do something about the property taxes and the impact of the California influx growth on our landmark businesses that have been part of the history of Austin.  Seeing places like Hills have to close is heart breaking and just changes the feeling of the city.  We can't Keep Austin weird anymore and that's saddening... our quirky small-town big-city is gone.  There's a lot of good things still here... save them! Support the small /local businesses with decisions that don't force them out!
918,"Listen and represent the hard working tax paying citizens of Austin.  We are tired of the excessive tax burden and cost of living in the City.   It is forcing long term home owning residents such as myself to move and leave the city limits.  We can no longer afford to live here.  It's very sad.  You seem to care more about the homeless and being a sanctuary city than about the citizens paying all the taxes.  We are drowning in excessively high costs of living (housing, water, utilities).  We get no break or appreciation.  HELP!"
919,Stop spending on all the fringe programs.  Start concentrating on essential services.    Stop trying to be a liberal haven.   Stop trying to be California.

922,HOMELESSNESS
923,Please slow the growth to allow for better planning
924,RESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
925,"Accountability for city employees should be reviewed. Seems like some higher ranking employees are provided greater leniency than their subordinates. Also, MCS ruling are often questionable."
926,I am concerned with rising tax rates especially as I near retirement.  I also have concerns over the recent camping ordice in the city.  We recently passed a tax increase to assist with homelessness.  Maybe it was not enough to address the problem but with the camping ordice the city is likely to attract far more homeless citizens than can be provided for.  Also I really dislike bike lanes!
927,You are too liberal. Austin did not become a great city with people like you running things!
928,Quit making low or no tax deals w/ big companies.  Austin is an attractive place for business any way.  These businesses will come w/out these deals.
929,BRING MORE BIOTECH TO AUSTIN
930,QUIT BEING SUCH A BLEEDING HEART
931,SPENDING MILLIONS ON A WALKWAY BRIDGE IS NOT WELL SPENT.
932,"Don't allow public camping on public spaces
Unless it's on the sidewalk in front of city hall or the mayors residence"
933,"Traffic is the only thing I am concerned about that needs immediate attention. I am also concerned about crime, but I think our police chief is working on this and heading in the right direction."
934,Affordable housing and better public transportation is needed.
935,"Don't try to be the 'ideal city'....just focus on what made Austin a great place.     Fun, open inclusion, weirdness, convenience of getting around, safety."
936,Take care of infrastructure; focus on IH35.
937,rethink homeless being able to camp on public property
938,Create a program to significantly lower taxes for long term residents and families passing those residents to other family members.  This would allow for established residents to keep their homes while allocating the higher taxes to those who want to move to the city.
939,Spend more time doing your elected job and less time political posturing on national issues that City personnel should be doing on the or personal time- MAYOR ADLER
940,Make the basic city services your priority.
941,Austin is one of the most extreme liberal cities I've ever lived in. It's ridiculous how much government caters to liberals and refuses to consider the views of conservatives.  The mayor needs to be replaced immediately because of his policies.
942,"Gentrification, exaggerated property values and the subsequent taxes and costs of living are causing many of the people and businesses, that have given Austin it's character, to move out."
943,"Please don turn Austin into Seattle, San Francisco or Los Angeles"
944,"Get back to being a Texan and not a Californian.  Pay less attention to people moving here and the revenue they will bring and more to the citizens who made Austin a great place to live. High taxes here are driving our citizen heroes out of town, along with the iconic restaurants and small businesses, while large developer buddies are busy tearing down what's been good for a long time.
If the Mayor is so interested in helping the homeless, how about letting them camp on the front lawn at his home. The recent changes are insane. Maybe he should move to California, so we can get a reasoned Texan in that position."
945,"Get the homeless litter blight cleaned up!  This is enabling, not helping the people."
946,"You don't have a mandate to do what you want to do.  Even though you got re-elected, there are a lot of us that don't like the job that you are doing. You should try to serve everyone with some common sense approaches.  You are helping the few and hurting the many."
947,PLEASE STOP BRINGING IN SHADY DEVELOPERS-LIKE DAVID WALLACE-TO MAKE DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. THE CITY IS GREAT! STOP PUSHING MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS OUT! (LOW INCOME) PEOPLE MOVE HERE FOR ART AND MUSIC-WE CAN'T LOSE IT.
948,PLEASE PROTECT THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS AND POOR FROM THE EFFECTS OF RAPID GENTRIFICATION. SOON AUSTIN MAY LOOK LIKE SEATTLE.
949,THE CURBS AND GUTTER NEED TO BE PROPERLY MAINTAINED. YOU NEED TO LOOK AT LOWERING PROPERTY TAXES FOR RETIREES
950,DON'T GIVE IN TO PRESSURE FROM BOTTOM LINE FEEDING CRIMINALS/ EXPOSE ABUSES OF POWER. DON'T WASTE MONEY ON STUPID STUFF. BE SOMEONE WE ARE PROUD OF TO NAME AS OUR MAYOR.
951,Too liberal
952,"REDUCE TAXES, DON'T RAISE THEM! Austin residents are getting priced out of living here."
953,Help the homeless.
954,Offer tax incentives for native Austinites. It's important for our community to have born and raised citizens remain in this community to help preserve what makes Austin so great.
955,Housing & Transportation
956,"Austin needs true affordable housing options. Stop gentrifying east Austin, slow or stop the ridiculous multi-use developments, do not raze affordable student housing east of I-35 for another ridiculous giant development, and find ways to allow older Austinites on fixed incomes to stay in their homes. Greed is RUINING our city."
957,Absolutely disappointed in the irresponsible decision to allow the homeless to camp and run rampant throughout the City.
958,"I love it here. I don't care about jobs and industry as much as I do quality of life. I'm glad you didn't court Amazon. I miss the days when it was a place for government employees, aimless graduates, artists, and natives. I value diversity and everyone feeling safe and welcome. I value diverse jobs in areas that also pay the bills. I think this discomfort is happening everywhere and I don't know what y'all can do about it. No one has a good map on growing and no one wants to have the problems San Francisco and Seattle have. I know you're making the best choices you can with the information you have and I hope the advice is good advice regarding affordability and housing. So far I don't see more housing make it more affordable. I just see more unaffordable housing. When we have our 5% (not much) of units be affordable, do they remain affordable or can you then sell at market? City values aside, it's as though the economy does not want you here if you're poor."
959,Transition to homes for homeless on the street
960,"Traffic congestion, affordable housing, and addressing the rapidly rising homeless population are top concerns and I know these are some of your top priorities as well. Allowing the open camping is causing safety issues, and litter issues. There is a routine homeless camp behind my home for years. Previously we have been able to clean out these camps to try to keep this water runoff critical area clear. I am worried about the effects of flooding (due to trash clogged creeks) and where this litter (including used needles) will run into. My cousin was assaulted before sunset downtown after leaving dinner over not handing over his phone to a homeless man. I don't vote against ballot initiatives to aid the homeless population. I think these types of initiatives would benefit from better awareness campaigns. The new rules allowing them to camp and trash the city and waterways is not a good option. I know we can't help those that don't want to be helped and there are no perfect answers for all but we have to have better options."
961,Property taxes are ridiculously high.
962,Need to improve traffic flow
963,"My heart is broken by your choices of growth, encouraging more than 1-2 tech companies to come here has destroyed the fabric of this very unique town.  Also allowing the homeless ordice to change prior to having a solution was so incredibly short sides and not what the people wanted makes us mistrust your intent."
964,Fix the traffic problem
965,More high quality museums and cultural centers
966,"Mr. Mayor, while I'm sure your intentions are good, authorizing and endorsing homeless camps is bad policy, and is not any kind of acceptable solution to the city's homeless problem.  It is an abdication of responsibility, both to the individuals living in such conditions, and to the communities you serve, which deserve to be kept both safe and pleasant.  The nearby greenbelt area (Country Club Greenbelt), which should be a community jewel, is instead overrun with homeless encampments, and now, the city and parks officials who formerly worked with our community association to (humanely) remove and clean up homeless encampments say there is nothing they can do, because of the change in city policy.  The city is spending tens of millions to build paths from the area to Ladybird Lake; meantime, we can't get the city to remove mountains of trash, dangerous needles, and tent cities from the greenbelt and its paths and waterways.  Most of the well-intentioned but misguided policies the city has adopted to deal with the homeless problem are eerily similar to the failed policies of California and the Pacific Northwest, which area of the country we left for Austin, wrongly thinking that Texans had better common sense.  You should expect the same bad results.
I have heard the Mayor say that he wants the city's homeless policies to be a model for other cities, to which I say, ""What policies?""  The city is building a trivial amount of beds, slowly, and at great cost.  The few facilities you have in place are grossly inadequate and unsafe.  You need to partner with the private sector and let them build larger facilities, faster and cheaper than the city can, without all the red tape, aka San Diego tent breaks, which I'm sure you've heard of.  I realize there are no easy answers to these questions, but the city is moving in the wrong direction of endorsing community blighting encampments rather than addressing the homeless issue in any kind of effective way.  Recognize that when the only community input you seek on these homeless issues is 1-3 minute snippets at endless city council meetings, you are hearing from the extreme left, and not the regular citizens who must work during these marathon meetings, but who live and work in these communities, hold a very different point of view, and suffer the consequences of these misguided policies.  Unfortunately, a political environment has been created whereby any citizen who doesn't concur with the extreme left on issues of this nature, is treated with extreme disrespect in city forums, and, sadly, the Austin city council members tolerate it.  That is not democracy.  We all are legitimate voices in this city and ought to be able to work respectfully with one another towards solutions on homelessness and everything else this great city needs."
967,Deal with the traffic. Create effective public transportation options. Address the political / religious hatred which infects Texas and Austin by virtue of being in Texas.
968,TOTAL WASTE TO SPEND 3 MILLION DOLLARS ON CODE CHANGES. QUIT SPENDING MY MONEY ON LEGAL CHALLENGES TO PROTECT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT THREATEN MY SECURITY ON ROADS AND HOME. MOVE TO PORTLAND. JUST SOMEWHERE ELSE.
969,Stop wasting tax payer money on his ridiculous initiatives that only hurt the citizens of this city.
970,Number 1 would be the traffic.  We have more bike lanes than people who use them.  Everyone walks are bikes occasionally but it seems the city is forcing this.  We all can't live across the street from our work like  the mayor.
971,"ALL EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE PAID A LIVING WAGE, BUSINESS SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES."
972,"My family and I love it hear, but are worried that the lack of planning for Growth is going to significantly degrade the awesome city we have."
973,FIND SOLUTIONS FOR HOMELESSNESS
974,"Born and raised here. I love it!  But I fear I will have to move somewhere else when I retire, will not be able to afford it.  Property taxes keep going up.  Traffic has not been planned for at all!"
975,Be prudent stewards of tax dollars.
976,Fund the parks department.  Create new parks and pools.  We need more parks space.  Do not shut Zilker down during the best weather of the year for ACL.
977,HELP THE HOMELESS ANOTHER WAY
978,RECONSIDER THAT DENSITY OF HOUSING MAY NOT BE WHAT IS THE BEST TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY.
979,The city HAS to get the housing affordability under control especially for those new in the job force and those on fixed income(retirement).
980,"Stop raising taxes our money is just being sent to other counties.  Spend the money wisely as if it was coming out of your own bank account.  Stop taking trips, now days we have conference calls and even video conferences.  Long-term home owners need to have your respect instead disregard.  We have paid to own homes, paid taxes, and been long-time members of this community and it seems like in a rush to get more ""affordable"" housing we are being forced out by rising taxes, rising property values which means paying even more in taxes, and no visible improvements for most of our main streets.  South Austin residents have more difficulty going North of the river on same old streets with more traffic and new bike lanes will not resolve that issue!"
981,"Focus on fixing the homeless problem, and STOP allowing the tent city to grow, before it completely destroys the downtown Austin area."
982,"Fix your property tax issue, you have plenty of new people moving to Austin daily, you don't need to gauge your residents.
Deal with the homeless, shame on you for putting the problem on everyone else, you wanted the job, now do the job. If one child is harmed because a homeless individual was on school property you should be held criminally responsible."
983,BETTER ROAD AND BICYCLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND BETTER TRANSIT OPTIONS.
984,Pay as much attention to & demonstrate fairness to small & medium sized  business as to the large companies & entities.  Major problem!
985,"Stop homeless camping, you are only creating more problems"
986,Focus on current residents rather than trying to bring more people in or encourage more tourism.
987,Austin is a great city but the homeless are getting aggressive to the point of stopping me inside library and businesses asking me for money.
988,Re instate homeless camping ordice
989,The permit process for home owners should be easy and user friendly. To me the permitting process is a tool of gentrification and taxation. I don't disagree with it. But I think it should be looked at and refined.  The homelessness situation has been perpetuated by the COA and providing more services will not help. Private funding should direct  the efforts the City makes for this.
990,Do not cater to the homeless who do not support but only take away from our beautiful city. Support the workers and majority of Austinites who make this city special.
991,Do a better job at providing faster emergency care.
992,Secret deals and negotiations are unacceptable. I'm thinking of soccer here ..
993,Fix our out of control tax increases.  10% increase per year for last 10 years.  Really?
994,Take a close look at your priorities for Austin and do not try to attack every issue at the same time at the expense of resolving any of them!
995,Lower taxes
996,"Fix something, anything, please"
997,"I know I am very fortunate.  I live in one of the safest, well-kept zip codes in this city.  I make a good living, and I am blessed.  I am very concerned about growth and the resulting impact on our citizens, resources, and quality of life.   Why are we still giving companies like Apple a 100% property tax rebate and other incentives?  While there are obviously some benefits to locals from adding these giants, the reality is a large percentage of the jobs they create are not being filled by locals.  With > 150 people / day moving here, are we really making things better for the people of Austin?"
998,"Represent me and focus on LOCAL issues, not national politics. Work on solving Austin's issues and keep politics out of it."
999,House the homeless!
1000,Lower property tax. Fix traffic now
1001,Affordable housing!
1002,Please make businesses pay their fair share of property taxes.
1003,Slow growth and attend to our infrastructure. Don't build more when your infrastructure is deteriorating.

1008,Help the homeless
1009,"Used to be proud of Austin and tour visiting friends around.
Now it's just a crowded nasty city."
1010,Get homeless out of down town
1011,"focus on mass transit, roads and quality of life for Taxpayers --  do not focus on homeless--we do more that MOST cities and we can now focus on other concerns with our limited tax dollars.  Get the light rail to run to UT and the airport so we can get cars off the road"
1012,I have worked with persons experiencing homelessness and would like to encourage the city to continue its efforts to address these people's needs.
1013,Solutions are needed for the traffic and homeless population problems
1014,Need to handle the homeless population issues differently
1015,"Please, focus on the quality of life here, tolerating excessive homelessness doesn't promote safety."
1016,Please let's not turn into San Jose.
1017,Lower property taxes.
1018,"Please make an effort to stay politically centered.
Our city council has such a strong bias to left-leaning agendas, it seems to get in the way of good effective policy."
1019,fix the homeless situation.
1020,"More aggressively fund the Police, resort the confidence of sexual assault victims, make our parks a place people want to spend time"
1021,Stop GIVING AWAY my tax dollars and start using them more efficiently!!
1022,Investigate 311.
1023,"Move from reactive leadership to proactive leadership that is data-driven, strategic, and mission/vision-driven. This city is on the brink of losing what made it so special to those who were born and raised here."
1024,TOO MANY PANHANDLERS.
1025,Please don't let Austin go the way of San Francisco
1026,"I would suggest that the focus of the city should be on helping maintain and improve what we have now. It seems that too many issues are being discussed and then decisions made without determining the ramifications of it, such as with the law allowing loitering on public land. We should leave laws such as these alone for now and work on enforcing the current laws. We need more police presence so that our citizens feel safe in their own neighborhoods. Once this is complete and satisfactory, then we can work on the other issues."
1027,"Manage this city on the budget allocated annually, cut out the programs which produce nothing - like dancing garbage trucks (yes taxpayer dollars went to fund this!), and stop increasing city fees.  Know that we do NOT want more bike lanes, fewer driving lanes, or frivolous spending of our tax dollars."
1028,Cut taxes
1029,"We need to make this city affordable for everyone, including the low income and middle class. It is currently only affordable for the upper middle class and wealthy. We need to take a stand against property taxes."
1030,"Fix the traffic and roads. Sounds like a whiner, but it is something that affects us multiple times per day."
1031,Please be fair to Austin residents & not drastically hike up property taxes...many of us can't afford this & it would put a huge strain on our families.
1032,Provide better services to maintain our medians and roadways.  City looks trashy and unkempt.
1033,stop being a pawn of developers- protect the trees of Austin.
1034,"Start making this city a desirable and affordable place to live again by addressing some of barriers to that (such as traffic,  property taxes and homelessness/vagrancy)."
1035,Please find a better solution for homeless situation.  Allowing them to sleep and take up residency on public streets is not the answer and is not safe for them or for citizens of Austin or visitors.
1036,"Overall, things are good in Austin, but transportation is the number one problem that needs to be fixed, both roads and public transportation options."
1037,"Get rid of the Vagrants !!!
1) STOP all pan handling.  No more begging on the corners.  You can grant special privileges w/ a permit.   
2) STOP allowing anyone from being able to sleep on the streets.
Give property Tax relief to Old Austin Businesses to help they stay afloat to preserve what little is left of Old Austin.
Give property tax relief to people that have owned their home for 10+ years before this growth occurred.   I just don't understand how it is fair that us Old Austinites are having to endure  high property taxes for something we had no part.  Austin Management allowed the city to grow as much as it did.  In my opinion they should have one foot on the brakes for the past 5 years, but they did not.   I feel like we as Old Austin original are getting penalized while the developers out there are raping our once beautiful and fun city."
1038,Reverse your public camping decision and clean up all the trash the homeless have left in our public areas
1039,"Stop allowing developers to build in our city. We will not enough water in the future, our traffic will only get worse, and the infrastructure will suffer if this growth is encouraged."
1040,Our neighborhood - Travis Country - needs options to be able to leave the neighborhood without using personal vehicles by Capitol Metro and by sidewalks and safe roads to walk to nearby businesses.
1041,Please find a solution for the homeless camping and panhandling before we look like Seattle.
1042,"STOP all policies that only increase the clogging of traffic-bike lanes used only by minuscule per cent, humping of streets everywhere (why not hump Mopac. ), bringing in traffic-cloggers like MLS, bigger convention centers, ghastly projects like THE GROVE, and inviting throngs to come to Austin for the freebies sleep where you want , panhandle where you want, load up on free food, clothes, health care. If you want to come here for all the freebies, do twenty hours a week of community service"
1043,Build a IH35 overpass over Downtown !

1045,PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT HOMELESS ORDINANCE.
1046,Horrible traffic which will never be rectified
1047,Preserving our diversity is important to our city.  Gentrification has robbed us of so much color and culture.
1048,"Please fix the traffic issues. Taxes in Central Austin are skyrocketing. Those of us that live here will be forced to sell our homes, and move to the suburbs."
1049,the homeless thing is a disaster.  as a kid when every other person was a hippie we never had anything as ugly or ridiculous as this
1050,"There is a limit on the amount of taxes that residents can and will be capable of paying.  Because of the City's continuing high property tax rates, and its  politically correct, progressive electric and water rate structures, young folks and retirees are forced to sell their homes and move out of the City.  Fortunately, there are near-by alternatives with better living conditions!"
1051,Solve the homeless problem
1052,My comments above on the homeless issues.
1053,Please figure out a way for single income people making less than $70k/year to live by themselves.
1054,nothing is good
1055,The homeless crisis is ruining our city and the city's actions have made residents distrustful. The lack of transparency is scary. Our distrust is warranted given the example of the Arch. Our vibrant downtown is becoming a place people are scared to go. Please listen to the taxpayers.
1056,"Even if I pay off my home at retirement, my property taxes are so high I will be forced out  of my home  when I have a fixed income - only the very wealthy can own a home here."
1057,Taxes and cost of living in Austin too high.
1058,Please improve  traffic congestion...
1059,No more big business tax exemptions!!
1060,Stop ADP from giving out frivolous traffic citations and put more time into actually helping people.
1061,"The homeless population has not only become an overwhelming public health issue, it has also made the city-wide panhandling, not only intrusive, but uncomfortable.  I've lived here my whole life and I no longer go anywhere alone or unarmed. 
I feel the lack of regulation in zoning and permitted allowances for the homeless population has gotten out of control making the rural parts of the city intolerable and unbearable."
1062,"As a public school teacher, I will not be able to afford to live in Austin if my property taxes are raised any further. Thank you."
1063,Do something about reducing property taxes!!
1064,"Get rid of tent city, revitalize 6th street corridor (Broadway in Nashville as example)"
1065,More emphasis on the under-served population rather than the privileged.

1067,Cost of living | property taxes needs to be addressed.  Stop letting California money dictate.
1068,We need more police officers.
1069,Restart the sit and lie ordice
1070,"Really needs to find a solution to help the homeless, as it is out of control. There is a homeless person on every corner asking for help.  Need to stop allowing them to camp anywhere they want. The city needs to start fixing and repairing the sewage and drainage, and this cost needs to be passed on to all new building and construction instead of the current homeowners."
1071,"I am concerned about the homeless families and very concerned about the military who come back and become homeless, and unable to find a job"

1197,"Diversify the economy beyond tech and stop the gentrification by technology companies and their wealthy relocated employees.

1198,"I love this city, but there's a lot of work to do"
1199,Give the support needed to APD to help them do this most difficult job.  They are too shorthanded and need to have the additional Officers approved to be at full staff for a city the size of Austin.  They also need support to repair their main headquarters.
1200,"Y'all are doing great! Please keep trying on progressive issues and local control of issues, like the one-use plastic bag ban and Sick Leave benefits requirement. Your efforts are seen and appreciated.  People still sometimes use re-useable bags even if not mandatory, and that happened because the City of Austin had banned the one-use bags, for as long as the State allowed it..."
1201,Solve the traffic issues
1202,Let's give out tents and let the homeless live in your neighborhood Mr. Adler.
1203,fix the roads and traffic

1208,Expand the roads if you can. Services are doing great.
1209,Do something about the homeless living on our streets and under bridges!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1219,"There is a LOT of good in this city and corporations and developers make a lot of money here - they can afford to contribute a bit more than they do to make sure that Austin is for all, not just the wealthy."
1220,"I love this city. I was born here. I think our leaders over spend and make bad decisions about the way our tax dollars are used. I would hope that budget wastefulness could be addressed and some of the burden could be taken off the shoulders of property owners in this city. Things could be addressed in a more modest way.
Or maybe I should rent out my house and go live in that super nice REI tent (complete w/mountain bikes) under the Airport/I35 overpass. This is ok? Really?"
1221,"Please retain the weird old timey Austin , and support the creative class through innovative policies and subsidized housing. They are the a primary reason tourists come."
1222,Provide the citizens with better options to commute to/from work and expand the bike path and trail system.
1223,I   would like to know if there is a plan for the homeless?
1224,The mayor Needs to broker a deal between Milestone and the Four Points area before the city council approves ridiculous SF6 rezoning at the end of a residential street (Milky Way) that will endanger lives with fire issues (think Steiner Ranch Fire). It needs to follow subdivision rules set by city of Austin but Milestone is circumventing the set subdivision rules.  Need them enforced- Thanks!
1225,"I believe in political correctness, but I feel that the mayor and council should be more focused on the majority of our citizens."
1226,Fix property taxes so people don't lose is heir homes to gentrification.
1227,Please get these north freeways working from north to south so that traffic flows and there is no backup.  I think there should be speed limit on the freeways for people not driving fast enough. Some other cities have a speed limit that if going to slow you get a ticket.  40 miles is the limit that people should not go under. These people going 30 miles an hour is not safe.
1228,Allowing the homeless camps was a mistake. You should have had a better plan or response before implementation.
1229,WHERE IS THE HOMELESS POPULATION PLAN?
1230,"COST OF HOUSING IS UNSUSTAINABLE, TERRIBLE COMMUTER TRAFFIC"

1235,"THERE IS NO BOHEMIAN SECTION OF AUSTIN, IT MAKES ME SAD."
1236,INSTITUTE HOV LANES RATHER THAN TOLL ROADS LIKE PHOENIX AND SEATTLE.
1237,I love living here! But please fix the traffic and the potholes.
1238,Add trains on more routes
1239,Slow down the amount of industry coming to Austin to help save our resources
1240,I am proud to be a resident of Austin. There may be areas that need improvement but I feel our city is always looking to improve.
1241,DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES OF SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK CITY REGARDING HOMELESS POPULATION AND ENCAMPMENTS. RESERVE RECENT CHANGES MADE BY CITY COUNCIL REGARDING HOMELESS ORDINANCES.
1242,KEEP ON KEEPING ON
1243,"As a lifetime educator, I find it incredibly difficult to afford to live in Austin.  Property taxes are ridiculous!"

1265,FIX UP OUR ROADS AND CLEAN AFTER MAJOR CONSTRUCTION.
1266,STAND STRONG AGAINST STATE'S ENCROACHING ON LOCAL CONTROL.
1267,HIGHER CULTURE FOR OVER 50'S.
1268,"I am overwhelmed by the amount of panhandling, vagrancy and homelessness in Austin. I believe there is a place for everyone in Austin. When expectations are set for behavior and opportunities are aligned with appropriate community services (housing, mental health, job mentorship) only then can you truly move forward in creating a cultural and socioeconomic inclusive environment that is the hallmark of any great city. 
When families and the community at large no longer feels safe visiting the cultural center of the city, that community begins to die from the inside out - with people seeking safer and cheaper neighborhoods in an increasingly distant ring around the city center, building farther and farther away with each new housing opportunity.   There is a visible disconnect between understanding what the problems are that create this suburban flight and how to appropriately address the challenges with thoughtful, long term, sustainable solutions."
1269,"I would like to see the city orient much more of it's activities, particularly in planning and economic development, around equity and, in so doing, articulate a clear notion of equity that will guide decision making."
1270,Cap the property tax rate for seniors (over 65) at rate when they reached 65.
1271,"LISTEN MORE TO CITY TECHNICAL STAFF, LESS TO NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS."
1272,Reduce the homeless population

1279,More affordable housing
1280,Bury I-35
1281,MADE US PROUD WHEN HE INTRODUCED MAYOR PETE. HIS SPEECH WAS AWESOME.

1283,CLEAN UP THE MONTOPOLIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
1284,IT HAS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS ONE IS QUITE WELL OFF FINANCIALLY. I HAVE LIVED IN AUSTIN FOR OVER 40 YEARS-ALL MY ADULT LIFE- BUT WILL SOON LEAVE AS I CAN NEVER HOPE TO RETIRE HERE. SAD

1293,GET RID OF SCOOTERS.
1294,Quit giving tax breaks and fee waivers to companies to entice them to move to Austin.
1295,"Focus on core services like streets, parks, libraries, and utilities. Please stop focusing on non-core services like child care, food, and housing. 
The city spends too much time on dialog and civic engagement, residents have already told you what we want, please stop asking and start doing."
1296,OFFER MORE AND COMPREHENSIVE BUS SERVICES THROUGHOUT NEIGHBORHOODS
1297,RECENT CHANGES REGARDING THE HOMELESS POPULATION WILL GREATLY AFFECT THE BUSINESSES IN A NEGATIVE WAY.
1298,your doing a poor job start with getting read of all deadbolts that drain owner city
1299,we need to crack down on the homeless pan handling bums or we're gonna turn into san francisco
1300,The overall level of safety is appreciated.  I wish the growth was better planned.  It is sad to have buildings taking over shopping areas and recreational areas.
1301,We need more housing and better transportation ASAP!
1302,HOMELESS NEED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. PUBLIC CAMPING IS A BAD IDEA.
1303,Mopac still sucks - too many people moving here- plan for more growth
1304,Please get rid of the scooters!  Please change the law back to keep homeless off the sidewalks.  They need their own place to live.
1305,Continue to march in the same path.  Don't give in to moneyed interests at states or national level.
1306,do not be dismissive of opinions you do not personally agree with.  Your job is to serve all citizens.
1307,would love if Austin could get a rail system that linked the city and the airport
1308,We need to be aware of the impact of development on the city. City is not taking advantage of the fact that people want to live and work here. We need to say no to luxury apartments and demand more affordable housing units.
1309,WE need a plan to ensure facilities keep up with the speed at which we are growing. Traffic is unbearable.
1310,"Affordability is key (in Housing, Transportation,  healthcare and essential city services)"
1311,Deal with the homeless situation.
1312,Improve lighting in residential areas around UT Austin
1313,Code next was a disaster. Do not destroy old neighborhoods by increasing density
1314,Traffic
1315,Rethink the homeless camping ordice.  We really don't need to become another Seattle.
1316,VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE GROWTH DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTIN. TOO EXPENSIVE AND POOR PLANNING FOR GROWTH.
1317,WHY TAXED OUT OF MY OWN HOME?
1318,code enforcement should be VERY responsive to residents concerns.
1319,"HELP WITH TRAFFIC, REPLACE 29TH ST."
1320,Traffic is a problem
1321,PUT SPEED BUMPS ON MY STREET COPPERFIELD DR 78753
1322,"FOCUS EFFORTS AWAY FROM TERRYTOWN, FIX PUBLIC ROADS, AND PLEASE CUT IT OUT WITH THE TOLL ROADS."
1323,CITY WIDE WALK
1324,Please continue to improve bike lanes so we can commute safely and keep our cars at home.
1325,The homeless situation and the ordices. Transparency and real communication with citizens. Austin is a swamp now. Hate it that I have homeless people surrounding my home. You will go down as the worst mayor. You are an idiot.
1326,I would love to see a light rail system from Southwest Austin to Downtown (actually throughout the city.)
1327,"Quit giving tax breaks to large corporations who move here.
Companies that want to move here will do so without the tax breaks and those that don't shouldn't move here.
It's a disservice to residents to tell them there's a COA budget downfall (meaning closing pools and decreasing other city services) while at the same time giving out tax breaks to billion-dollar corporations."
1328,More parks/pools/bike lanes/rec programs in SW Austin!
1329,BE MORE THOUGHTFUL WITH ROAD AND TRAFFIC CONTROL.
1330,FIX I 35. SCHOOL ZONES NEED MORE POLICING.
1331,MOST CONCERNED WITH BEING ABLE TO STAY IN MY HOME OF 40 YEARS.
1332,Traffic improvement.
1333,The way they handled the homeless camping ordice was awful - pretty sneaky
1334,BE SURE ALL COA IT SYSTEMS ARE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH RANSOMWARE AND OTHER CYBER THREATS. I AM CONCERNED THAT COA IS NOT NOW. CONSIDER RE-ORGANIZING THE SECURITY GROUPS AND ALL COA IT SERVICES TO STRENGTHEN IT SECURITY. COA LACKS A SECURITY OPERATOR CENTER.
1335,"Wish we had better public transportation, metrorail would access other parts of town"
1336,"Figure out transportation options for getting to and from the airport, work and home.  Sitting in hours of traffic everyday is soul crushing."
1337,QUIT SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY AND TAXING US TO DEATH. YOU COWER TO EVERY MINORITY AND HAVE SPECIAL PROGRAMS FOR JUST A FEW.
1338,"IT IS GETTING TOO EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN AUSTIN, QUALITY OF LIFE HAS DECLINED."
1339,"Do SOMETHING about the homeless, public camping, etc.  Austin is well on its way to becoming the next LA or San Francisco!"
1340,clean up the homeless situation
1341,"Since you will not change, do not run again."
1342,"Get the homeless off the street. Give the drug addicts rehab.  Any old or disabled, provide housing."
1343,"You have a thankless job and I believe you are trying. State, national and local politics and the influence of big money, however, seem to be thwarting many good efforts. I see the bureaucracy of the city, as an organization, being pretty dysfunctional. Fiefdoms exist and many Department managers and leaders seem to be closed to meaningful change. I believe that your performance management systems are ineffective and HR is driven more by fear of lawsuits than by common sense."
1344,"tone of the civic conversation in Austin has deteriorated; I hear more negative comments about the city than in the past; my personal interaction with city government less satisfactory - less transparency, difficult to get the information you want vs prepared presentations that city wants to provide"
1345,"let social services and private sector  deal with the homeless. take back control of public spaces and streets eliminate street solicitation get them out of the intersections.
homeless are here because of all the freebees. Last week we had visitors from out of the city and all of there comments were that they could not fathom allowing the homeless to camp under the bridges and the vast amount of panhandling."
1346,"Public transport and planned, sustainable, affordable growth are the most important issues."
1347,"Public transportation is horribly insufficient. My neighborhood sidewalks are falling apart, causing injury to joggers. Not enough lighting. To many car and house break ins since building bridge over little Walnut Creek. Crime is up and another low income housing development is being built in our neighborhood against residents' wishes. This will be the second one in the last few years. Homeless people camping everywhere, makes it dangerous."
1348,"Way too many tolls, we will eventually have to pay to get in & out of Austin. No more tolls. Traffic issues as the city grows"
1349,"find a place for the homeless people to live, ban pan handling and camping in public areas"
1350,STOP TURNING AUSTIN INTO CALIFORNIA! Let Austin represent Texas. Erase Keep Austin Weird and change it to what it should have been. Keep Austin Cool
1351,Gun control and background checks
1352,Thanks for caring about the homeless. Have sanitation services clear the garbage that accumulates around the camp sites.
1353,Work on the homeless problem.
1354,Save our historic neighborhoods from overdevelopment
1355,PLEASE CONSIDER MORE STATE FUNDED RECOVERY CENTERS
1356,"Please get a hold on the traffic issues and road rage drivers. I'm frightened at times just driving down the road due to other drivers running me off the road, driving erratically and threatening me. It's scary!"
1357,"Please lower property taxes. Austin is not affordable to honest, hard working citizens. The cost of living is too high. We do not need social programs or special projects. Focus on the infrastructure and public safety."
1358,Homeless and transient population. It is becoming an immense burden on the City of Austin. I have safety concerns.
1359,Don't let the growth of Austin (and the big investment dollars) ruin the spirit of Austin
1360,"I love the City, but I wish people would stop moving here. We do not have the infrastructure to support this level of growth, nor is it pleasant to go to events/shows/etc. with such large crowds. I'm saddened that so many local businesses (Austin ""institutions"") are closing due to rent that is too high, or worse, being pushed out by residential apartments or condo complexes."
1361,How do we make housing affordable again?
1362,Watch how the city is growing and keep around places that make Austin what it is.  Keep rent affordable for those of us who live and work and are from this city so we don't have to move away and provide services that are also affordable.  Also keep it clean and safe.
1363,Help people over businesses with tax breaks for properties. Build more train lines.
1364,"Would like to see clean up and the homeless helped, especially at the intersection of Highway 35 and US Highway 183 E Anderson Lane. Thank you."
1365,"Something needs to be done about the traffic.  Our roadways are not equipped to deal with current (and future) traffic loads.  It feels like the traffic situation is being created as nothing seems to be happening to relieve the overflow.  An extra Toll lane on MoPac?  More toll roads?  These aren't solving the problem.  Additionally, something should be done about blatant traffic light / stop sign violations.  Daily, I see at least 6 cars blow through the left turn stop light (Northbound Dessau to Westbound Parmer) at every exchange, once was even a fire truck (2 cars followed after it).  On 2-lane roads that I take to avoid heavy traffic on my way to work, folks blow through stop signs and pass on double yellow lines consistently.  It's frightening."
1366,"Traffic is Terrible... Toll Roads are not the Answer... Electric, Water and  Sewer Rates need Auditing. If you want to have individual homes reduce water usage/waste why does Austin take an average of the neighborhood??? I barely use any water in my house and pay for my neighbors usage...."
1367,"Overall, I enjoy my quality of life in Austin and think it's a great place to call home. I do wish there were some things I could address and would love to be considered for a committee to help change those things."
1368,"A living wage for all, affordable health care, keep the streets and common areas clean on east Riverside, this is a well traveled route into Austin from the airport and is one of the first areas our guests see, let's give them a good first impression of A-town."
1369,Property taxes are insane and really hard to afford
1370,Match city growth with infrastructure developments
1371,"Please value the needs of the residents, especially middle class and lower income residents, over the affluent and business interests. They can purchase what they need, whether it's private pools, gates, taking Uber all the time, belonging to a country club, etc.. The lower and middle income folks need access to amenities and enrichment to be provided by the city, and to keep a sense of a healthy place to raise a family, we need to preserve affordable home ownership as at least an option."
1372,"Easiest solution to traffic is getting folks off the street at the same time so please continue to encourage business and govt. to allow flex schedules, work from home, etc."
1373,"If you want the citizens to speak to you, make time to listen even if you have to schedule several days to do so. We make time to speak up on things that are important to us."
1374,"Austin cannot sustain it's growth including but limited to inadequate roads, water table, downtown and other cultural area parking and generally overcrowded which is driving out music culture and being un-affordable."
1375,LOWER THE ELECTRIC RATES.
1376,Stop trying to make Austin like Portland or any other city. You should be trying to serve current residents rather that the needs of future prospective residents.
1377,"Please control rent prices somehow. I love my neighborhood, but will be priced out of it soon. I would like to be able to live alone as a single woman in my 30s, but am doomed to have roommates forever, even though I have a steady job making more money than I've ever made before. I work hard, I contribute to my community, and I deserve to be able to afford to live in this neighborhood in a rented apartment or house.  I'm not asking to live in west lake here. Just the east side."
1378,"Great city, but it's sprawling - get rid of the cars and provide pedestrian-friendly environments, improve public transportation."
1379,Lower our property taxes!
1380,Housing affordability. Traffic congestion.
1381,Do your best.
1382,"Stop the rise of big government encroaching on individuals. Also, don't run again."
1383,Stop growing areas without road capacity.
1384,Please stop trying to turn Austin into a city in California. Haven't you seen the mess that places like San Francisco and San Diego have in their downtown's?
1385,Don't be wasteful. Quit spending money with no accountability and pretend it's your own money from your bank account that you're spending. Focus on where you are going to put all the people moving here and they will be able to travel on our highways.
1386,"Need for high-quality, affordable housing."
1387,PLEASE make urban light rail a reality - we CANNOT rely on CapMetro to decide alone. They are SLOW to adapt. They can't even take CC's at vending machines for Metro-rail. Geez!
1388,FIX THE TERRIBLE TRAFFIC. NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YEARLY TAX HIKES ARE MAKING QUALITY OF LIFE UNSUSTAINABLE.
1389,Thank you for all you do for ALL of Austin's citizens. Your thoughtfulness as Mayor is unparalleled and with more council members that operate like you our city could truly flourish in a responsible and equitable way.
1390,"Lower taxes cut social programs, increase transportation/roads."
1391,"Don't let the NIMBYs stop us from having nice things like public transit (light rail), better connected bike and pedestrian systems, and a land development code that supports dense, affordable housing!"
1392,"We really need better, faster, more reliable public transportation!"
1393,housing rates to high
1394,"We need to focus on transportation improvements in Austin--which would have downstream effects in affordability, cleanliness, etc. of the city."
1395,IMPROVE TRAFFIC FLOW AROUND TOWN AND ON HIGHWAYS.
1396,"Fix the traffic issues on Mopac. Plan for the future not the present. When you plan for the road improvement, plan for what the population will be not what it currently is. It always seems the city is out of date."
1397,"Concentrate on providing all 9f Austin with  upgrades and maintenance of roads, not just downtown.  It seems that more and more of my tax dollars go to improving downtown while we have potholes growing ever bigger in south Austin.  Share the wealth man!"
1398,"Please, for the love of god, ban people from owning roosters within city limits. Chickens are fine, but roosters are the worst."
1399,Please help public school teachers afford to live in the city where they teach. Thank you.
1400,housing affordability needs to be addressed and fixed if Austin is to be a viable city
1401,"Put together a mass transit program that makes sense.  A light rail system should have routes where the people are, not where we think they will be in 10-15 years.  We need immediate relief.  That is why these proposals keep getting voted down.  Other options should be considered, it's too late and expensive to tunnel for subway, too disruptive to lay rail down on already busy streets.  I have been long a proponent of sky link or monorail downtown transforming to in ground track outside of city center.  These routes should take pressure off Lamar, Riverside, Mopac, Cesar Chavez/Fifth Streets, South First,  downtown parking needs, and should service the University, the Zilker Park area and capitol complex."
1402,HOMELESS DOWNTOWN ARE IS A PROBLEM. MOVE THE HOMELESS FROM DOWNTOWN.
1403,"Possible parking affordability downtown with longer hours. Most street parking is only for 3 hours, if you have to work 8 hour and have to move your car and find another spot to park because you are not to just feed the meter is very stressful! Most parking garages have a waiting list for monthly parking.  
Traffic light are to long!!!!! Guadalupe, Congress, 1st street is pure torture."
1404,"Stop recommending  that Austin become a sanctuary city and go back to the Liberal Ivy League area where you came from.  In other words, get the hell out of Dodge!"
1405,"Make our roads safer. Constant traffic accidents, people speeding and running Stop signs even at schools. Living in the NW boundary (Canyon Creek) is no excuse for lack of service such as traffic enforcement."
1406,Need more highway lanes on I-35 and Mopac.  The toll on Mopac is a joke!  Its mostly for out of towners like from RR or Dripping Springs not internal Austin residence.   Someone should be fired for not also adding another free lane on Mopac.  It already need additional work to support the traffic.
1407,"Please slow growth - we are not effectively the size the city is now. Give it time for the services, road system and transportation options to catch up. We do not need a pro Soccer team or bigger entertainment venues, raceways, stadiums. We NEED affordable housing."
1408,Please make all departments more transparent. It is really difficult to get anything done in this city
1409,Permitting process needs work to make it more timely and improve communication.
1410,lower cost of housing and mass transit needed
1411,Please partner with regional municipalities and move forward with the comprehensive light rail/commuter rail plan that already exists. Let's not continue being the city that's 30 years behind in transportation infrastructure. Busses aren't the solution.
1412,Really listen to what the people in all areas of Austin and all backgrounds would like to see for future of Austin
1413,"Property Taxes too high. Going to move out of Austin within the next 3 yrs.
Homeless all over the Highways making Tent homes and Trash everywhere.
Yard Maintenance for our Public Schools...  JUST MOW !"
1414,"Respect the central and east Austin neighborhoods, restrict demolition to uninhabitable  buildings  and restrict replacement of houses to maximum of two residences per lot and a height of two stories. Preserve parking requirements in order to keep neighborhood streets accessible to emergency vehicles and walkers."
1415,Please improve public transportation so that it is obviously better than sitting in traffic jams.
1416,"Please strive to facilitate the process for low and middle income housing and support all efforts for a decent minimum wage, reliable public transportation, affordable child care and early childhood education. Healthy adults are most productive and satisfied citizens when they can put a roof over children's heads and decent food on the table.
Since a significant number of adults in this city are NOT MENTALLY HEALTHY, please support adequate mental health services to help us to get there.

MOST NOTABLE TOPIC MISSING FROM THIS SURVEY: Homelessness."
1417,Stop wasting $ on social programs and affordable housing.
1418,"My utility bills and property taxes are forcing me to sell my house.  Too expensive.  Also, traffic is a nightmare.  Otherwise, Austin is great."
1419,Express lanes on MoPac for South Austin
1420,"Stay out of politics such as immigration issues, quit claiming you care about social issues like affordable housing while continuing to allow unaffordable housing to be built downtown so you can collect massive amounts of tax dollars to abuse. If one lives outside the 5 mile radius of downtown, you and the council members don't give a damn about except for their property tax! A 4.1 billion dollar budget is obscene."
1421,Need to better manage the homeless problem.
1422,SW Austin needs more swimming facilities and ways for to get around on a bike.
1423,You are making it impossible for elderly to live in this city. We can't continue to pay your increasing taxes. Why not make every third street for buses and bikes as older people can't walk to bus stops 3 blocks away and the roads are horrible to drive on.
1424,Reduce housing taxes.
1425,Take care of the City of Austin business instead of all your national political agenda.
1426,"Stop giving tax breaks for companies, and sports teams to move here."
1427,please clean up the streets and sidewalks downtown
1428,Bike lanes are not the answer in theory it sounds great but they are not. There is no way the city can control housing cost that would make a significant impact.
1429,"Make sure that the basic needs and necessities of the city and its residents are provided and maintained before spending tax dollars on other things or in other areas that may not be so important.
 Listen to the people of Austin. You were elected by the people of Austin to serve the people of Austin"
1430,Improve diversity efforts (start with affordable housing options)
1431,"Tap the breaks on the tax and fee increases. I understand we have to grow but let's prioritize policies and spending a little better. Did we NEED composting? I don't use compost, why do I have to pay for a bin? Am I going to leave Austin because of it, no; but every camel can only take so much straw."
1432,My concerns would be about traffic and the rapid destruction of homes for expensive modern blocks....
1433,"Please put bicycle lanes in the Quail Hollow area, such as Braker Lane.  Please make pedestrian crosswalks across Braker, Lamar, Metric, etc., so it will be safer to cross."
1434,"The employees at City of Austin Tax office need education on customer service. I know the job isn't fun, but when dealing with people they should be kind and empathetic as much as possible. I only saw one person smile the 2 times I was there last month. One manager (Monica Blackwell) treated me like I was no better then the dirt under her shoe when I asked her a question about a policy. Only one person there (another manager) treated me like a human being. He was able to convey bad news without treating me like an idiot on a conveyor line. Classes for City of Austin employees to teach them how to treat people would be an excellent idea."
1435,"Please take care of basic services first - utilities, street maintenance, mowing, facilities and park maintenance. Don't waste taxpayers money on travel, etc."
1436,get a new mayor
1437,Get a handle on water and electric billing practices. We get three or four amended bill a month. Why?
1438,Get off left of the daily and be more neutral in political approach. Quit squandering our tax dollars trying to fix things that are not basic public service.
1439,City future planning needs to improve dramatically. Property taxes are single handed lily going to ruin residential and commercial businesses.
1440,Better mass transport. FLOOD control - new flood plane maps should NOT move people into flood planes. Mitigation should fix flooding.
1441,"Stop being afraid of these people. They may protest everything but they believe in nothing. Stand your ground and do what's right for everyone not just the people that lie, cheat, and try to bully you into submission."
1442,"Provide permanent housing for homeless, especially disabled in any way, along with permanent access to social services near their home, perhaps through mini-house neighborhoods."
1443,"Right now I'm REALLY mad at Cap Metro. The bus ran me off the road four months ago and they don't care. We need a City-owned transit system with profits going toward improvement. In general, I am horrified at the flight of the poor (Black and Hispanic) families from Austin. I grew up in segregated Austin, and we're STILL segregated, and becoming more so. Shame, shame, shame."
1444,Better job opportunities for new residents of Austin.
1445,Affordability and transportation
1446,Lower property taxes or a cap because the property values are skyrocketing. Taxes go up every month.
1447,The City Council spends too much.
1448,Build more rail systems around the city.
1449,"Don't let the haters get you down, Steve."
1450,Make the downtown area safer. We have too many homeless people downtown and in Austin. I use to work downtown(until 2017) and walked on the sidewalks and around the lake and many times I did not feel safe. I had homeless guys follow me several times or yell at me. I do feel sorry for anyone that is homeless but it needs to be cleaned up.
1451,Please improve the traffic flow issues.
1452,"Pay attention to our emergency services and personnel, respect them, and support them. Get the police a contract, build the fire stations we need, raise their wages. The city manager could take a pay cut to help that out.
One thing I'd like to ASK the mayor is how many of the city council, or Mayor himself, ever rides the bus? or rides a bike? I often wonder, especially when they advocate riding the bus or biking to work and spend so much time trying to get people out of cars and onto other transport. As I noted in a previous answer, I do ride the bus almost daily (and love the Rapid) but it is not practical for many to bus into work or to errands. I also like the Cap Metro services for those elderly or handicapped who can't walk to bus stops."
1453,Please decrease property taxes!
1454,Homelessness is a real issue/problem that needs to be addressed.
1455,Provide value to the taxpayer by keeping the city safe and clean. Thank you for bringing an MLS team to Austin and hopefully you will consider other major sports teams as well in the future.
1456,I wish the City still felt welcoming to it's residents.
1457,Austin needs a well planned efficient mass transit system other than buses to accommodate the huge increase in population.
1458,"Because of its costly inefficiency, the Planning and Zoning Department needs to be audited immediately.  Raising fees is NOT the answer and goes completely against the Mayor's expressed desire for affordability.  Hiring capable people is the answer.  Clearly,  Austin would benefit from contracting with large engineering firms who would be more efficiently.  Private companies have a vested interest in providing fast, quality service.  City bureaucracies are notoriously slow and inefficient, and their dissatisfied customers can either like it or lump it."
1459,"Please do all you can to improve, keep strong, the relationship between law enforcement and our minority communities - make changes to protect those who live in our older, but now sought for property - do not tax these people OUT of our city!!!"
1460,do something to improve public transportation
1461,"I encourage density and avoiding sprawl but I don't see the infrastructure or strategy to support it. The bus route changes actually turned out worse for me and I stopped riding the bus, the construction doesn't seem to be strategic and there are multiple buildings being built on one stretch of road leading me to drive through one construction site after another - it doesn't feel like a pleasant city to live in when you feel like you live in a construction site... 
It feels like buildings are evaluated case by case without thinking about other things that are going on in the neighborhood. A very large condo building (300+ units) is going up right where a bus stop USED to be - and now the new bus stop is a 10-12min walk away. I imagine residents may have used that bus stop if it had stayed there..."
1462,"hold people responsible for their areas of responsibility. if they fail to meet expectations, there should be financial penalties, suspensions or loss of employment."
1463,Enforce rules against aggressive panhandlers. I have written Mayor Adler about this two times and did not receive a reply.
1464,"Stick to the core services , issues and cease unauthorized pursuit of too many issues that should not be involved.  balance the budget as the state of Texas must do without raising fees and taxes.  Runs the city finances and issues as I do my own business and family not pursuing pipe dreams and misguided issues."
1465,"More garbage pick up at my apartment. Keep avenue g pool open during summer. 
Reduce driving speed and crossing of all lanes in short order. More pedestrian awareness. Less accidents especially avoidable ones, which almost all accidents are."
1466,"I LOVE our new library downtown, and I LOVE that the city picks up my compost! Two great things from the city in the past year!!! I hope the city can continue to stay true to our character with no plastic bags polluting our water, no driving with cell phones, and with our police force keeping trust with undocumented residents!! I hope Bull Creek can be cleaned up so I can swim there with my kids again carefree!"
1467,SIDEWALKS AND STREETS ARE SOMETHING CITY SHOULD PROVIDE.
1468,"Fix roads, be transparent, control spending, pay down bond obligations, think like this is a town who is 35 and needs to stop acting like a 23 year with his parents diners club card."
1469,Develop a comprehensive plan to govern the City. Why do we let the City staffers determine how this city is run? Let's elect a Mayor who has a personality!
1470,"Lower Energy costs. 
Because Austin is a giving community there are more homeless here. Better management of the homeless population. 
Move ARCH facilities from downtown location."
1471,Maintain basic services and quit wasting time on issues you have no authority.
1472,Will someone have to die before we regulate scooters downtown?
1473,"Traffic signal system could be much better (i.e., automated to respond to congestion in certain directions, but less congestion in others, etc. . . . respond to the vehicle numbers at intersections and on streets . . . that technology is available)."
1474,"I am interested in having lots of really great future neighbors and friends here in Austin. In order for that to happen we need to focus on our schools. 
I know the city shies away from dealing with AISD but we may need to start a conversation soon.  Our special education aids that work directly with all of our mentally and physically impaired children make less per hour than our lifeguards at our city pools. Neither of which are a living wage. Teachers are paid less than retail store managers. By ignoring this problem we are screwing ourselves in the long run. 
We have to take the brunt of making ends meet off of teachers and aids plates so they may focus all of their efforts on guiding our future residents to be the best citizens they can be. 
AISD seems broken to me right now and we need to fix it quickly! 
Thanks for letting me get my two cents out! 
Forever in love with the ATX,
Melissa Bowman"
1475,Please don't Dallas my Austin. Plan for more affordable housing.
1476,I wish living in Austin were more affordable so that my children could live here. They couldn't qualify for a home in Austin but were able to qualify and purchase a great size home in Ft. Worth.
1477,"One thing I didn't see reflected in the survey is public education, which is one of the most important things to me as a parent and one of the things that sets Austin apart from the rest of the state. Our schools are amazing and should continue to be a priority. Even with the challenges related to declining enrollment and the mismatch between where students and schools are located, I believe and hope we can continue to provide the best possible education to our kids. Beyond that, I hope Austin will continue to be a diverse, welcoming, thriving, progressive city. We are already a positive example for the rest of Texas in many ways, but there is much work to do related to affordability, transportation, expanded opportunities for all, and integration (or at least connectivity between citizens and neighbors). Austin always has been and I hope will remain the best city in Texas!"
1478,We need more affordable housing right now we have my daughter and her family living with us because they can't afford housing. Also improve disability services and independent living and job services for disabled.
1479,Look for private funding for public transportation. Open traffic calming program back up. Put more taxes on development not residents
1480,"Hi, Mr. Mayor,
I pay thousands in property taxes yet don't feel safe here at 3116 Corbin Lane. Crime is up and criminals abound. Look at the abundance of tagging here in South Austin. My family has our home in a trust for me, a gift from my late Mother. If not, we could not afford to live here. We love the police a whole lot. Councilman Renteria helped me get fencing from the Union Pacific RR -- $100k - 1500 square feet - running from Bannister Lane to Oltorf,  since rocks were being thrown into our home. It's a scary world with scary times. I applaud all you do for us and have always been a supporter. Yet, I do feel as though more needs to be done. Homeless camps by the Gillis Park are scary. Folks carrying weapons and making public drug deals, in the park. Why don't you let homeowners designate a portion of their property taxes to the school their kiddo attends? My eight-year-old attends Dawson Elementary School. I ought to be able to designate a portion of my property taxes to her school. Sorry for my rambling thoughts (smile). Happy weekending, Mayor. ~ Tricia Potyka and Miss Nevada"
1481,"I understand that it is hard to retrofit streets to accommodate bikes. I believe the  Texas heat makes biking to work uncomfortable. Stop taking my road space for bikes. Overall I am very happy to live in Austin, good thing I was born here, I certainly could not afford to move here."
1482,Better quality of living for all people!!!
1483,start doing some well thought out long term planning
1484,Please help make our roads less congested. Thank you!
1485,Austin has beautiful natural resources.  To help the citizens enjoy the outdoors the city should control the mosquito population.  Each household is taking it upon themselves to curb the population. As a result each household is spraying many different chemicals into the air with little to no results.  There's got to be a better way.
1486,"Stop being so liberal.  We should not be competing with San Francisco.  My daughter lives there, but grew up in Austin.  No sanctuary city, please.  I took the time to answer your survey, then you ask for personal information at the end.  I don't know who access to this stuff.  Very disconcerting."
1487,I love this city. I am very dissatisfied with the ems responders that attended to me  attitude. I am concerned about affordability as I enter retirement. Thank you mayor Adler for your support of f fairness to all. I appreciate you.
1488,Taxes and traffic are horrendous
1489,"It may be time to stop the rapid growth until the area has an infrastructure plan for current and near term population. The city is large enough that there is a serious lack of non-laughable public transportation, especially for people living south."
1490,"Home and housing affordability. Traffic and public transportation. Needs to be more transparent that city is trying to do better. 
Code NEXT is a joke."
1491,The exponential increase in the housing taxes for the city of Austin homeowners is simply unrealistic. I am paying mortgage here in housing tax than I used to pay in rent. This is not affordable living. I thought I would be saving money when I bought my home and now that is just not the case.
1492,"Set up a special Internal Affairs division composed of retired veterans with honors in combat and conduct, to field COMPLAINTS about police, deputies, politicians, clergy, etc. and provide the public with competent oversight recourse if this division fails them. Recourse MUST enable the public to then make a permanent RECORD with the Governor's Office at own volition, NEVER BLOCKED in any way by Internal Affairs, and the record must come up for review by a grand jury for prospect of prosecution by an independent prosecutor.."
1493,"Too much focus on proving low income services. 
Put social services and affordable housing away from downtown where there is reasonable grocery stores or transportation."
1494,"Promote city growth, but preserve unique culture and historic aspects of Austin as well as parks and recreation. Plan for traffic/city mobility. Get ahead of it. Find mass transit solutions for central Austin (elevated trains, light rail) and commuter rails between Austin and Houston, Dallas and San Antonio."
1495,"build roads, quit pushing empty busses and bikes."
1496,Help with traffic
1497,Change the billing system of Austin energy to allow for more time between receiving the bill and having to pay it. And flexible payment schedules.
1498,Better metro rail transportation
1499,Cost of living is outrageously high while city maintenance and services are low.
1500,Think further ahead. Plan for what my children and their children will experience as adults should they choose to stay here.
1501,Would like more transportation options besides bus connecting downtown to the rest of the city
1502,TRAFFIC CONGESTION. TAXES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING
1503,"I would tell Mayor Adler that I appreciate his support for the ""Freedom City"" initiative."
1504,Keep working on traffic congestion and homeless support
1505,"Making changes to the efficiency of the planning and zoning department might help (not solve) the cost of housing in Austin. Taxes must be reduced and with more people to spread the costs to it should be achievable.  Although there are advantages to creating more downtown for visitors who help economy, those of us in the remainder of the city feel as though we finance it.  Further expansion of downtown needs a transparent plan of repayment from the people using it."
1506,Work on traffic congestion and the timing of lights.  Work on affordable housing.
1507,"The quality of the streets, street lights, and sidewalks are very poor unless you live in very rich areas of town. I am able to drive outside of my neighborhood to access nicer parts of town which is a pain but I can do it. For many of the neighborhood children, that is not possible and they simply don't play outside. Please, please fix the quality of those three things in areas like mine."
1508,Safety in the neighborhoods
1509,"STOP favoring developers over citizens!  Density is not the answer to affordability as this is dismissive of people's quality of life  earning less than $65K to force them to live in 450 sq. feet or 60-90 minutes away (one way). l The city has become economically segregated with expensive transportation costs and there is no protection for long-time homeowners to retire here.  The Mayor seems to champion policies that work for him and others in his socio-economic status while enriching real estate professionals at the cost of us people earning less than $65K per year ... my quality of life is OK but I cannot travel, I cannot go out to eat at a restaurant that is more than $10, and I cannot afford to attend activities in our public park that are more than $5.   Large commercial businesses should pay their fair share of property taxes and SHOULD NOT get incentives like tax breaks."
1510,"Telephone staff should be friendly and knowledgeable in order to help customers. If they don't know the answer, find someone who does; transfer the customer but give them the direct dial # should the connection be lost. Excellent telephone etiquette will introduce the City of Austin to new and existing citizens and a friendly voice goes a long way towards good relations."
1511,"I'm a Realtor and driving around Austin is difficult. I find myself stuck in traffic more and more. I understand that we have had a huge influx of people, but there should have been a plan in place for how to handle it. Turning road lanes into bike lanes is NOT the answer. Expecting people to somehow get to their metro stop that doesn't have parking and is too far to ride a bike is ridiculous.  I live in Great Hills. My Metro stop is at Kramer. Many people who live near me, work downtown and would be willing to take the Metro if there were a way to easily get there-or have a place to park their car."
1512,areas needing improvement: traffic congestion; homeless services
1513,Traffic flow is a real problem
1514,"Water cost is out of control, TOO High"
1515,"The east side needs more attention to its parks, pools, sidewalks, and roads."
1516,Coyotes are A MENACE.
1517,WORK WITH SURROUNDING CITIES
1518,TRANSPORTATION THRU THE CITY IS DIFFICULT.
1519,PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AUSTIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE ARTS.
1520,Plan for growth and traffic.
1521,I WOULD LIKE TO OWN A HOME ONE DAY. NOT CERTAIN IF WE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT HERE.
1522,"RAPIDLY GROWING SENIORS NEED VISIBILITY WITH SERVICES, ESPECIAL THE LGBT CITIZENS."
1523,"please continue to seriously consider the environment when planning for Austin's future. more green spaces and more policies that incentives both residential and commercial, recycling and conservation of natural resources.  thank you"
1524,"MORE EFFICIENT WAYS OF DEALING WITH THE RAPID GROWTH, FREEWAY EXPANSION?  TRAFFIC ON LAMAR MOST TIMES OF DAY IS MORE CONGESTED THAN NECESSARY DUE TO CONSTRUCTION."
1525,I ENJOY THE 10 ZONES IN AUSTIN. COUNCIL PERSON IS VERY ATTENTIVE TO ISSUES . ANN KITCHENS RESPONDED IN A PROMPT MANNER.
1526,BALANCE DEVELOPMENT WITH ATTENTION TO TRAFFIC. MAKE MORE LIGHTS SMARTER.  CITYWIDE COMPOSTING NEEDED. WE NEED LIGHT RAIL.
1527,I 35 IS A MESS. NEED BUS SERVICE IN ONION CREEK
1528,FIX TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. REDUCING SPENDING ON SCHOOLS. REMOVE THE HOMELESS. FINE LITTERERS. PROMOTE ANI- LITTERING.
1529,YOU ARE LOSING THE CULTURE OF AUSTIN BECAUSE OF GENTRIFICATION.
1530,THE MAIN ARTERIES SHOULD BE REPAIRED IN SOUTH AUSTIN. WE NEED COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS IT RAPIDLY GROWS BEYOND CONTROL.
1531,"REDUCE POPULATION GROWTH RATE, TOO MUCH TRAFFIC"
1532,PLEASE BE REALISTIC WITH TAX DOLLARS. THINK ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED. SELLING PUBLIC LANDS IS NOT A GOOD THING.
1533,"Transit, transit, transit! Additionally, cars don't like to give the right of way to walkers, joggers, or bikers (even if they have the pedestrian light). It's bad. I could literally keep a journal of close calls."
1534,"The longer real estate in Austin remains like this, the more likely Austin will become a city that loses its soul. Even for a household with our income, buying a property seems unattainable and rent isn't too far behind."
1535,"I need to be educated on my city and how I can serve 
Where would I go for a good general orientation?"
1536,Sidewalks are very important for the inner city/downtown.
1537,"Affordable housing, Austin is turning into a town where you have to be a millionaire to have a good quality life. Access to health services."
1538,Get downtown traffic moving.
1539,There are not enough affordable senior living facilities.
1540,The amount of construction on both high volume roads and residential is horrible. The new pavement shoots pebbles everywhere.
1541,"Fix the traffic on Mopac, 290, & 360. Less lights and bike Lanes, more car Lanes. Add public transit along all of 360 and turn it into a freeway. Add public transit South of Slaughter Lane between Mopac and 35. Finish the 45 toll road to 35 in South Austin. Transportation is so far behind here. Please continue to focus on getting us caught up. Beneficial light rail route options would be nice."
1542,PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND MAKE ALL AREAS OF AUSTIN SAFE.
1543,GET TAXES UNDER CONTROL. WHERE IS ALL THE MONEY GOING?
1544,Be fair to ALL constituents. Austin is NOT California.
1545,"Traffic is the 4th worst in the country, it needs professional services on how to manage. The soccer stadium needs to be built outside of the city."
1546,Support creative public transportation.
1547,Make the permitting process for construction more efficient.
1548,"TRAFFIC PLANNING, MORE LIGHT RAIL WOULD BE HELPFUL"
1549,DECISION MAKING AND PLANNING IN THE CITY HAS BECOME TOO SHORT SIGHTED. NEED A FAR SIGHTED VISION TO PRESERVE WHAT STILL SPECIAL ABOUT THIS CITY.
1550,"TOO MUCH TIME AND MONEY SPENT TO SATISFY MINORITY NEEDS. MORE EFFORT SHOULD GO TO MAJORITY NEEDS, TRAFFIC, GROWTH MANAGEMENT."
1551,"I think for those of us living here for a long time, it feels like the new, the money, the growth, the change are all more important to any type of preservation of our city and its ability to run smoothly or well.  Growth is good and inevitable, but growth without regard to how it will be managed in an appropriate way is not.  Rising property taxes and affordability of housing is terrifying. I would never be able to qualify for a house today in the city I have been in for 17 years.  I don't want to be pushed out but as my kids grow up and my income doesn't go up, I may be forced to leave.  Then what?  I am a white middle class person and grieve over those we have pushed out downtown in situations more dire than my own."
1552,"East West thoroughfare. It's about time some home owner's did the right thing & quit complaining or stopping what makes sense. We are going to grow so plan for it! 
Quit paying corporations. The soccer field out at triangle area off 183 was a Trump-like fiasco of money or common sense. The codes are so hard to follow, so serpentine in trying to find  - what, which, how, where in which neighborhood, garage set backs so that now we have so many carports & no garages? trees, Good grief, common sense."
1553,Accessing Mopac  from SW Parkway can take 5 min or 40 min depending on time of day.  BOTTLE NECKING and timing of lights
1554,MORE COMPETITION FOR UTILITIES.
1555,Keep up the good work on cleanliness.

1557,Practical train system
1558,We need roads.
1559,Fix zoning
1560,Make housing more affordable.
1561,Traffic is the biggest issue.  Fix it or at least address it!
1562,"coa has been behind the curve on the roadway system for years, please visit other cities that have more efficient roads to try and stay ahead of the problem"
1563,Make the city cleaner.  Send the homeless to areas where they are off the freeway and roads.
1564,"property tax are killing me, bought my house $25000/year now $12,500 year, not to provide me services but to subsidize everyone else, water, electric costs are outrageous, city govt only represents tax many consumer/never tax payer"
1565,1. EAST AUSTIN RESIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY. 2. LIGHTS NEED TO BE INSTALLED  - IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE ALONE IF YOU ARE A RUNNER.
1566,QUIT SPONSORING IRRESPONSIBLE LIFESTYLES.
1567,"no mention of AISD? very concerned on environmental long term impacts of our city, increasing impervious cover unnecessary ways, creating lifestyles dependent to high emissions, laws against grey water to minimize water/wastewater"
1568,"MAYOR AND COUNCIL ARE VERY IDEALISTIC, NOT REALISTIC. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR A LIVING. BIKES ARE NOT A REASONABLE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR MOST PEOPLE."
1569,WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE TRAFFIC.
1570,need to establish rent control
1571,WHY DO YOU ALLOW DEVELOPERS LIKE THE ONES ON BULL CREEK TO MISLEAD THE PUBLIC ON WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO? TRAFFIC ON BULL CREEK WILL BE ATROCIOUS AND IT IS A MAJOR COMMUTE ROUTE. WHY DO YOU SUBSIDIZE DEVELOPMENTS LIKE THE DOMAIN AND THEN COMPLAIN WHEN THEY BEGIN TO TAKE AWAY BUSINESS DOWNTOWN?  AUSTIN FEELS LIKE IT IS RUN BY CLOWNS.
1572,WE NEED TO FIX THE HOMELESS PROBLEM.
1573,CITY SERVICES ARE IMPRESSIVE GIVEN AUSTINS' EXPLOSIVE GROWTH BUT LACK OF SUFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS BECOMING MORE OF AN ISSUE.
1574,AUSTIN IS SLOWLY BECOMING A CITY I DO NOT RECOGNIZE.
1575,FIX TRAFFIC CONGESTION INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE MOVING HERE. FIX 360 CONGESTION ASAP.

1579,"FIX THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. QUALITY OF ROADS. TIMING OF LIGHTS. SPEED OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS."
1580,Please work to improve public transportation and improve bike safety on public streets.  Sidewalks would be great!  Faster permitting and inspections-Please!
1581,"More wide reaching public transport please! This will allow young people greater independence without having to have a car, therefore increasing safety too! If there were buses that took me out and to work, I would rarely drive my car."
1582,"The affordability of housing needs to go down. It's very expensive to live here. I make a decent wage, but when you support other people, it's still not enough to buy your own home. Houses in my neighborhood used to cost $175,000 when I first moved here, now they are upwards of $300,000. I hope to own a home soon, but at this rate I will probably keep renting."
1583,bring safety to montopolis improve crime rate for most crime rate area in Austin
1584,Affordable housing to buy.
1585,"I wouldn't live anywhere else in Texas, but we really need to do something about mobility in the south. I know it's coming but after 17 years I'm starting to lose hope I'll see it in my lifetime. Sidewalks would be nice and if it's not too much to ask for, please don't make the road smaller to put one in on one side of the street, I'd rather go without if that's the case, with all the big trucks in this city the streets are tight enough already. Thank you,"
1586,We need a comprehensive plan/vision for managing the growth of this city!
1587,"Mental health is real, our facilities are substandard and are not recommended by local professionals, and someone needs to be accountable. These people need real help, not just a band aide and to end up on the streets."
1588,URBAN DENSITY DOESN'T WORK IF THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT SUPPORT IT.
1589,"many lower income people who have been a major part of the Austin culture service industry, artists, musicians are moving away I seem to get a  going away party every  week, it will only be a matter of time before Austin will only be the technology companies we gave incentives to but no  character"
1590,I am happy to live in such a culturally diverse and stimulating city.  We need more affordable housing and a fully staffed police/fire/EMS service.  In retirement I will be forced to move to find better resources to housing and safety.
1591,BE TRANSPARENT
1592,"The City and council is making it too expensive to live here.  I am not just talking about housing.  Forcing small businesses to pay for sick-leave, they will have to raise prices to compensate for this, passing the cost on to us-the consumers."
1593,"The homeless ""population"" is a real problem on my street.  I live on Rundberg and they are aggressive."
1594,KEEP AUSTIN GOING
1595,THE 3 THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO AUSTIN'S VIALITY ARE TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENT AND EQUITY
1596,"Lack of mass transit for the masses.  Making Austin affordable for the masses(food, housing, healthcare, city utilities, re-distribution of wealth."
1597,I THINK OVERALL THE CITY IS DOING A GOOD JOB.
1598,"CONCENTRATE ON PEOPLE THAT DO NOT RIDE BIKES, AS WELL AS SENIOR CITIZENS."
1599,BE TRANSPARENT. THIS COULD START WITH AN AUDIT OF CODE NEXT CONTRACT. IT IS A SCANDAL THAT THE CITY PAID SO MUCH. WHY DID THE COUNCIL OR SOMEONE NOT DO DUE DILIGENCE.  THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND LANDSCAPING MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THE CITY ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN.
1600,"Cost of living is too much!  Food, rent, the traffic - all the things we spend extra money and time doing that prevent us from enjoying life.  I shouldn't have to work 2 jobs and 75 hours a week so I can spend 2 hours a day with my kid because this city has gotten so darn expensive.  It wasn't like this when I moved here.  It's only getting worse and the rich, out-of-towners who are just now moving here are the one's causing the inflation of everything here including tofu!  It's ridiculous.  The city is pretentious and not the city I feel in love with.  The only ""weird"" thing about Austin is that a 1 bedroom apartment is over $1200/month."
1601,TRAFFIC improvements
1602,Figure out the traffic before we keep inviting business and more people here to live.
1603,"GREW UP IN AUSTIN AND NEVER HAVE I SEEN A CITY GO FROM BEAUTIFUL TO A CITY COVERED IN TRASH LAND OVERGROWN COMMON AREAS, THE RIDE FROM THE AIRPORT SAYS IT ALL, I HAVE BEEN TO MANY BIG CITIES INCLUDING A RECENT TRIP TO WASHINGTON DC THEY SEEM  TO TAKE MORE PRIDE IN KEEPING THEIR CITY CLEAN. FIRST THING I NOTICED IS THE RIDE FROM THE AIRPORT WHAT A HORRIBLE FIRST IMPRESSION WE ARE GIVING WHEN DID IT BECOME OKAY FOR THE PEOPLE HERE TO LIVE IN SUCH DIRTY CITY"
1604,"QUIT WASTING RESOURCES ON FAR LEFT POLICIES, SANCTUARY CITY, LAWSUITS AGAIN ICE AND THINGS SUCH AS CODENEXT."
1605,"Work better with TxDOT to improve major roads. ALSO get Government (State, Local, County) to begin real telework programs."
1606,Property taxes are outrageous.
1607,Concentrate on doing a great job at basic services.
1608,I'm really worried about affordable housing and preserving African American neighborhoods/diversity.
1609,"Keep Austin clean, affordable, and weird."
1610,"Austin traffic and transportation options are stopping us from becoming a world class city. Please help! Ok 2 things, please do everything you can to keep Austin's art and music scene alive despite how expensive the city is becoming."
1611,"The quality of life in this city SUCKS! In case you missed it before, I am an Austin native.  This actually used to be a nice place to live - years ago - but city administration has been so piss poor that there has been no master plan to keep this a nice place to live.  The developers own this city, and me an my fellow citizens have to pay for all the crap that they build with my tax dollars.  The condition of the roads is awful, traffic is awful.  I hate it here...........but I do have a plan to get out, and I will.  Don't ever give anyone in city administration a raise - they don't deserve it.  You do an awful job and should be ashamed."
1612,FIX THE PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS!
1613,"Austin is a miserable excuse for a city. Everyone was asleep at the switch until the 1990s...no planning, no effort to see the future...and we were caught with our pants down for transportation and other infrastructure. Then the 90s came and greed/growth exceeded all else. Still no effort to improve transportation/infrastructure and the era of Will Wynn saw us give away the farm even more to developers. Now we're overcrowded and everything that was special about Austin - everything you've been selling to the outside world for 30 years is trashed. You can't go to Zilker Park anymore because it's been sold to special events most weekends of the year. And when you do go you have to pay to get in, pay to park. You can't go to the green belts or trails because they're just too crowded. Music is dying a rapid death because you put all the stinking condos downtown and decided the clubs were too loud, then the inflated land values doomed the nightclubs, and our ridiculous cost of living has further doomed the musicians. ""Live Music Capitol of the World"" is not just a joke, it's a downright lie. City government is directly responsible for destroying the music scene. And Code Compliance, Jesus, find that news report about Code Compliance showing up at that guy's house, in force, in kevlar vests, with cops in tow, all because he built a shed too close to the property line. And that insane response the city had to that poor schmuck who dug tunnels under his house. That's what Austin has become - taxes, ordinances, intrusion and suppression."
1614,We don't want that stupid soccer team!
1615,"Need to be more inclusive of all races. The divide and lack or racial diversity is painful in Austin. Also, traffic SUCKS!"
1616,Please work to make Austin  affordable!!
1617,"Please finds ways to improve public transit later at night, and/or loosen regulations on neighborhood bars and restaurants to serve alcohol, as it's created a culture where meeting for drinks is usually centralized in a few, highly populated areas, with few reasonable transit options available to avoid drunk driving."
1618,Homeless people  sleeping on the streets and underpasses.
1619,GIVE RETIRED RESIDENTS MORE FINANCIAL BREAKS.
1620,"More public transportation options from north Austin towards UT/downtown, please."
1621,I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE MORE SERVICES ALL AROUND THE CITY FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE.
1622,"Publish the city budget, be honest, and do not hide anything."
1623,Improve the transportation infrastructure and find a way to lessen the property tax on people who feel like they are funding everything.
1624,TAXING OWNERS OUT OF THEIR HOMES TO RELOCATE OR BE HOMELESS.
1625,More red line rail stops and bus routes that intersect with stops are crucial.
1626,RE-THINK STARTING A LETTER UNDER MY LEADERSHIP
1627,Slow down new development and new residents.
1628,The soccer thing should have been at Burger Stadium.
1629,"Stop the panhandlers, it's not safe."
1630,Less focus on growth and bringing in new businesses.  Stick to a reasonable budget.  Improve infrastructure for vehicles.
1631,"I grew up in Austin, I still love Austin (and am proud to be a resident), just starting to worry about affordability and traffic.  I know how difficult these are to address, so any efforts are appreciated.  Better public transportation is a good start!"
1632,"Don't punish supervisors just because they didn't spend ALL the money they budgeted in the FY. The comment I was told was, Since you didn't use it you don't need it all so I'm cutting your budget."
1633,THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICES YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB. PLEASE CUT PROPERTY TAX RATES AND ANNUAL REVENUE GROWTH TO THE EFFECTIVE RATE.
1634,"The city is much larger than the vocal residents of Hyde Park. Growth should not be scary, but it will be if small, moneyed residents are able to curb it at every turn. Go Austin FC! Don't let the council defeat the stadium initiative."
1635,Invest more in our teachers and education system in Austin.
1636,Cost of living is higher than most salaries. It degrades the quality of life.
1637,Improvement in the way regular transit staff treat disabled people.
1638,Quit raising taxes every year.
1639,Lower taxes and improve traffic.  Stop taking turn lanes and turning them into bicycle lanes.
1640,PLEASE DON'T RAISE PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE WHEN I CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE I DON'T WANT HIGH TAXES.
1641,Let the people vote when you plan to change the quality of their lives.  No behind the door deals!
1642,"With the influx of people moving here, we need to make sure drivers are being SAFE!  You have to wait 20 seconds before going through an intersection to let all the red light runners through (my previous daily commute - 290 W and William Cannon intersection).  Let's enforce the rules we have in place."
1643,IT SEEMS THE CITY'S ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE HAVE'S WELL OFF AND THE HAVE NOT'S LOW INCOME.
1644,"Fix the transportation issues now, not 6 years from now.  Projects and process takes too long.  See prior comments."
1645,Get a mobile office and travel the city. They could be exposed to real time problems while continuing to work with digital communication. This would speed up solutions.
1646,Make 35 underground.
1647,AUSTIN IS BECOMING A BORING AND HAND TECH CITY.
1648,Love this city!
1649,"Consider neighborhoods and communicate with neighbors when developers build. Our street is so old, it cannot handle the volume of traffic now."
1650,PLEASE! STOP RAISING PROPERTY TAXES!  I can't hold on much longer.
1651,RECYCLE WEEKLY
1652,Build more roads and hire more police.
1653,People making less money should be able to buy homes in the city.
1654,"Rename I-35, from 290 to Ben White, Willie Nelson Hwy.  It would add charm to that stretch of highway.  Then the city could run an add campaign called ""Spending' time with Willie!, so then people would think it is cool to get stuck in traffic!  Rename lower deck to ""Outlaw Country Dive"".  Rename upper deck ""Stevie Ray Way"".  You are Welcome!  I love my city and all the city employees.  Keep up the great work!"
1655,We need a better code process.
1656,THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING AUSTIN ACCOMMODATING GROWTH. DEVELOPMENT CODES MUST ALLOW FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT.
1657,Please improve Mass Transit.  We need access to the rail on the east side.  We do not have any at this time.
1658,QUICKER DSD PERMIT REVIEWS AND MORE CITY INSPECTIONS.
1659,PLEASE TRY TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE CITY CONSIDERING AS MANY VARIABLES AS POSSIBLE AND OVER ALL FAIRNESS OF THE DECISION.
1660,Austin is too socialistic. Too concerned with giving things away. Property taxes are too high.
1661,Please address the affordability of living in Austin.
1662,"(1) Lanes for scooters. (2) Expand rail system (time and location) and more affordable. (3) City does not accessible handicap spots, maintenance for wheelchairs. (4) Rent is excessive."
1663,Mental health training for police.
1664,FOCUS ON FUNCTIONS CITY EXISTS TO PROVIDE.
1665,Keep Austin safe. Don't let our city be another San Francisco or Portland.
1666,"Provide more aggressive traffic calming on Scenic Brook Drive in Oak Hill. The existent speed bumps are insufficient. Stop cut through traffic. Children, walkers, animals, and bicycles are put at risk."
1667,PLEASE CLOSE THE AUSTIN REC CENTER TO THE HOMELESS AND THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY FOR PROGRAMS. PLEASE DISCONTINUE THE PRACTICE OF ALLOWING PUBLIC SHOWER HOURS AT REC CENTER. PLEASE CREATE AND ENFORCE A NO LOITERING LAW AT CITY FACILITIES. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE AND I AM LOSING CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.
1668,STOP THE BUSES FROM WAITING BLOCKING THE ROAD TO PICK UP AND DROP OFF RIDERS OR TO GET BACK ON SCHEDULE.
1669,ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES REBATES OR SUBSIDY TO WORK FROM HOME.
1670,"LACK OF EQUALITY REGARDING HISTORY AND ETHNIC GROUP HISTORY, GIVING IN TO PRESSURE TO JUST EITHER GET THEM OFF YOUR BACK OR LOOKING TOWARD VOTES ."

1672,"STOP RAISING TAXES. PAY ATTENTION T OUSE. GET THEM TO REVISE ROBIN HOOD, IT IS KILLING TRAVIS COUNTY."
1673,WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF SUPPORTING THE HISTORICAL RESIDENTS OF EAST AUSTIN.
1674,Traffic.
1675,PLEASE FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THE CITY IS AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED HERE THE LONGEST TO STAY AND MAINTAIN THEIR LIFESTYLES. FURTHER SCRUTINY OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES AND PROJECTS AND MORE RESTRICTIONS ON THE HOUSING OPTIONS THEY CREATE IS ESSENTIAL.
1676,PLEASE CONTINUE EFFORTS TO DECREASE PROPERTY TAXES.
1677,Consider the future and if people will be able to afford to live here.
1678,"FOCUS ON BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOV'T, NOT ADVANCING SOCIAL AGENDAS. TREAT ALL FAIRLY WITHOUT VILLIFYING SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. FOR EXAMPLE: POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING BY ANN QUNCINA INTENT NOT TO ATTEND VETERANS DAY PARADE WAS CLASSLESS."
1679,START TO SOLVE THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM-WORKING HIGHWAYS OR ADDING OVERPASSES AT CHOKE POINTS WON'T ACCOMPLISH A SOLUTION.

1685,NO to sanctuary city!!!
1686,Quit raising property taxes.
1687,There is a high to homeless assistance in South-East Austin. Large homeless camps under overpasses and on every street corner bring down property value and deter tourism.
1688,Build soccer stadium at McKala Place.
1689,Stop incentivizing growth and density.  Put Code Next through the shredder.  Get rid of parking meters being installed off trails by Austin High.
1690,Stop putting planters in the middle of the street. Trying to make people get out of their cars and walk and ride a bicycle really doesn't work in Texas and besides Texans love their trucks!
1691,Reduce city taxes!!!
1692,"Stop/limit building of ""luxury"" apartments/condos/homes - focus more on safe, stable, clean structures that the middle class can afford that aren't in Kyle or Buda.  A two bedroom home is not affordable when it costs $300,000 plus.  Tech is great, but you need blue collar and other occupations to maintain the infrastructure of the city.  Those occupations are vital for day to day operations, yet those in a field where salaries are less than 50-60,000 have limited ""affordable"" living options that don't require a long commute on our overcrowded roads and poor public transportation system."
1693,Improve traffic flow!!!  Eliminate paid street parking at lakes and parks.
1694,FIX HOMELESS PROBLEM
1695,He has done a great job!  Is accessible.  Thank him for his service.
1696,lower our water and wastewater costs!
1697,"To make city streets safer, cut the speed limit to 25mph. It has an oversized effect on injuries and deaths. Look at the stats."
1698,Police enforcement to eliminate drugs traffic in 800 block of Rutland Dr.
1699,We need better public transportation
1700,"Stop fighting the outside audit.  Listen to voters and stop bending to the will of developers.  Manage the city, as you were elected to do,  and  stop opining on matters that do not concern the city of  Austin."
1701,"The cost of living in Austin and the surrounding v areas is 100% absurd. Beyond ridiculous. I would do anything to have the ""old Austin"" back."
1702,Clean up Cameron road and no to code next
1703,Please make it affordable to live here again.
1704,"Clear up the traffic flow. Plan ahead so streets don't have to be torn up repeatedly. The flyovers are turning Austin into Chicago, and I don't understand why business owners aren't raising Cain with all the traffic going overhead. It's the same as sending all the traffic on a loop around the city where they don't stop to shop. Austin is great if you are young, love music, and have money. Otherwise, it sort of sucks."
1705,City of Austin bills are totally outrageous.
1706,"Please uphold immigration law, get rid of homeless bums, make room for cars not bikes and reduce city government tremendously. Thank you"
1707,Help keep local businesses thriving.
1708,we need a better bus system some bus routes did not run Mondays if you go to work the bus routes should run all the time and on Monday
1709,Stop the socialist agenda of Greg Casar
1710,"I believed in you until I saw you and council members jumping around, high fiving one another after Lyft and Uber were voted out.  Thousands of people were put out of work.  SICKENING."
1711,Please put in place a green energy program for residential home owners to switch to 100% renewable energy.
1712,"Represent the Citizens of Austin, not developers, corporations, contractors, or any other business interest. Be a true civil servant and not to abuse the position they represent."
1713,"I wish we could get some kind of rail system so that our city was more like other cities that have chosen density as their growth strategy. Also, I feel like people using alternative transportation like e scooters should still have to follow some basic traffic laws. As it stands now, many people riding the e scooters ride on the street, on the sidewalk, and wherever else they like with little predictability. It makes it extremely challenging not to get into an accident with them while I am in my car or as a pedestrian."
1714,"There is a lack of inclusivity for transplants - people moving into the area. There is a feeling that the only way to keep Austin weird is to keep new people out.  One of the wonderful things about Austin is its diversity.  That diversity only happens with new people from different backgrounds moving in. This should be encouraged, not discouraged."
1715,"There are many things I have to say about the City of Austin but the one that most affects my daily life is the quality of roadways from E Riverside Dr heading south. Riverside Dr is in my opinion the worst road to drive on. Montopolis is in dire need of repaving from Grove to Ben White. The sidewalks need to be cleared & there are other trails that need tending to, not just the Lady Bird Lake Hike & Bike Trail. In other words, this entire area has been neglected, other than by contractors & developers."
1716,WORK ON THE TRAFFIC PROBLEM.
1717,"Efficiency, rationality, equality in use of our city dollars"
1718,"Please invest in off road urban mountain bike trails that link Balcones, Gracywoods, and Walnut Creek Parks.  Currently, there is a paved path that links these parks but the addition of off road urban mountain bike trails would be a huge economic benefit to the NW Austin area as cyclists from all over Austin would use this trail system similar to the current extensive trail system of the Greenbelt and spend time in local businesses in NW Austin as a result.
Also, please link the North Walnut Creek paved path to the South Walnut Creek path to provide a safe commuting corridor to cyclists from NW Austin to East and Central Austin."
1719,Audit the books . Would like to see if there is any waste in that 4 billion dollar budget
1720,Please do something about all the homeless people around Slaughter and I35.
1721,Austin has many fabulous qualities but the city is slowly destroying those qualities by allowing developers to build what they want where they want. Fake concern is given to the current citizens to placate but then the approval is given for another tall building that completely blocks out another building and destroys real estate value along with adding to traffic. Even these surveys won't help because the city only wants to show concern. They clearly do not want to take responsibility for massive traffic concerns by taking action. The disregard shown by the city is very hard to fathom.
1722,Get a new job
1723,Get the darn construction jobs under control & done
1724,More shopping downtown because malls are over. Cap metro could offer better service to school. Need more flexible transportation options.
1725,More night time safety measurers downtown.
1726,quit worrying about state and national issues and work on things for Austin
1727,thanks for his hard work
1728,ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE COST OF LIVING. REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF BIG DEVELOPERS. AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF POVERTY FIGHTING SERVICES IN OUR CITY.
1729,"this type of survey leaves a lot of room for bias, discrepancy and inaccuracy."
1730,Please focus on addressing inequality and public transportation within our city. I'd love to see our city apply design thinking to try and find innovative ways to try and address these problems in Austin. Sustainability is also very important to me.
1731,Building affordable is gentrifying neighborhoods is a good idea but still should pay something. Big apartment projects with cheap rent ruin neighborhoods. I don't like MUD's though.
1732,IMPROVE TRAFFIC
1733,GIVE YOUR PRESIDENTS AN EFFECTIVE CITY WIDE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM FOR COMMUTERS. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE CLOSE TO OUR JOBS AND WE ARE KILLING THE ENVIRONMENT.
1734,FIX OAK HILL 290/71 TRAFFIC PUT IN FREEWAY OVER PASS.
1735,"I know this is a difficult problem to solve, but the availability of mental health services to the homeless would be a great win for Austin."
1736,SLOW THE GROWTH UNTIL CAN GIVE THOSE ALREADY HERE A BETTER AND MORE AFFORDABLE QUALITY OF LIFE.
1737,Please keep expanding choices in natural and healthy/holistic programs.
1738,Homeless shelter for women.  More cost friendly rent.  More cost appropriate child care.  More cost appropriate healthy food.  Affordable housing for all incomes.  Fix more potholes.
1739,"I love the rate at which Austin is growing and diversifying, however, I'm always concerned at how far behind road and highway development is compared to current population and especially compared to future growth populations.  I feel roads/highway development is always trying to catch up and never done in accordance with future projections for growth."
1740,Get rid of the dockless scooters!  More affordable housing.
1741,The permitting process for small businesses needs to be improved to shorten the amount of time required.
1742,FOCUS ON MOBILITY BECOMING WORSE EACH DAY. DECISIONS MADE TODAY TAKES YEARS TO DEVELOP SO ADVANCED PLANNING IS CRUCIAL.
1743,Austin needs better transportation methods - more public transportation.  Better park management and cleaning.
1744,GET RID OF TAX BREAKS TO BIG CORPORATIONS.
1745,"traffic, population explosion without infrastructure to support it"
1746,NEED TO INCREASE MINIMUM WAGES.
1747,We must redistribute wealth.  Rich get richer.  No more middle class.
1748,PRESERVE SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES. KEEP AUSTIN LOCAL.
1749,"FOCUS ON RUNNING THE CITY WELL INSTEAD OF PERIPHERAL ISSUES LIKE SACTUARY CITIES, LGBT, DIVISIVE ISSUES.  OUR CITY IS MORE THAN JUST THE WEIRD RESIDENTS."
1750,"support all environmental responsibility development and let a rail system be planned to provide public transportation that is clean fast and reliable without continuous of the eco system by continuous rail/drip more roads, there will never be enough roads to support the growth in Austin"
1751,KEEP OPEN SPACES AND EXPAND RECREATION AREAS. LOVE THE CONCEPT OF TREES AND PLANTS AROUND SHOPPING AREAS.
1752,OUR BUS AND LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM ARE INCONVENIENT FOR MANY BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED SERVICE. EXPANDED LATE NIGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
1753,METRO RAIL
1754,LOVE THE NEW URBANISH. LOVE AUSTIN SPIRIT. KEEP STANDING UP TO OUR BACKWARD STATE GOVERNMENT. DON'T FORGET FLOOD CONTROL.
1755,"I understand the demand for the cost of infrastructure and the desire for improvement in Austin is high but if property taxes continue to increase at the rate they  have in the past decades, will there be any of the business or people left that make this city great"
1756,LACK OF THE COUNCIL TO EFFICIENTLY ACCOMPLISH THEIR JOB OF MAKING THE CITY RUN AND EXPAND TIMELY TO ACCOMODATE GROWTH.
1757,TRAFFIC PROBLEMS
1758,PRESERVE AUSTINS COSMIC COWBOY CULTURE AND SITES
1759,Make spaces accessible to the performing community.  Almost all accessible arts spaces have shut down due to development and have not reopened due to prohibitive costs.  This will damage the culture of Austin in the long term and drain much of the talent to other cities.
1760,"improve transportation, highways, city streets, public transit, don't let property tax drive people from their homes"
1761,HOME OWNERS SELL THEIR HOMES DUE TO RISING APPRAISALS. SINCE THERE IS NO STATE INCOME TAX PROPERTY TAXES ARE VERY HIGH. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS TORN DOWN. MILLION DOLLAR HOMES BUILT ON THE LOT AND THE NEXT TAX APPRAISALS MAKES OTHERS HAVE TO SELL.
1762,STOP TALKING DOWN CONFEDERATE STATUS THAT IS PART OF HISTORY PLUS STOP REMOVING SCHOOLS THAT IS ALSO PART OF HISTORY.
1763,TAXES AFFECT NEW HOME OWNERS AND SMALL BUSINESS. MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO STAY HERE.
1764,"listen to area residents who oppose TXDOT plans to put in super hwys that destroy areas like Oak Hill, continue your efforts to make Austin a sanctuary city and place which is safer, cleaner, moving forward instead of backwards"
1765,I REALLY WISH AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE HOMELESS GET MORE HELP. WHETHER TO BE MORE SHELTERS SOUP KITCHENS OR EVEN RESOURCES. WE HAVE SUCH A HIGH POPULATION AND NOBODY TO GUIDE THEM AND HELP THEM.
1766,the city seems to be trending towards being a place where only the affluent are welcomed and their desires are given priority over the desires and needs of the less affluent citizens
1767,"Better management of the homeless population.  Either redirect where they choose to be, or reduce the population through more restrictions on camps and panhandling locations."
1768,"public safety needs to be priority with the growth Austin has experienced APD need resources. The code enforcement dept needs to take a page out of the dallas handbook to get a handle on the slum lords here. one family owns 200 plus properties in Austin and their are slumlords, there are terrible housing conditions and trash which lead to more crime but code has no bite, they need to be empowered"
1769,The state recapture tax system is going to send people packing - Austin ISD = -50% plus $ State.  Let's get a rail system like Denver or Amsterdam.
1770,"Improve traffic on major highways such as 360, MoPac, I-35, Ben White."
1771,Keep Austin affordable for a broad income demographic.
1772,GET CONTROL OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. THEY ARE AGGRESSIVE AND FEEL OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY CITY LAWS.

1774,"protected bike lanes on all major N-S or -W routes congress, s 1st, cesar Chavez, MLK, slaughter, anderson to name a few"
1775,Please have more affordable housing options in areas w/good schools.  The housing affordability in Austin is terrible!
1776,"WE NEED BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. MAYBE THE BUSES WOULD BE USED MORE IF THERE SHADE AT THE STOPS,BUT ITS TOO HOT MOST OF THE YEAR TO WANT TO TAKE THE BUS OVER DRIVING."
1777,Mass transit.  Light rail - invest as soon and as much as possible.  Traffic is reaching the point of choking the city/metro area and impacting quality of life.
1778,"I WOULD SUGGEST NOT SPENING MONEY ONADDING BIKE LANES WHERE THE COMMUNITY IS NOT SAFE ENOUGH OR NOT WILLING TO BIKE, LANES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY IN SOME AREAS TO SIT EMPTY FOR A BIKE LANE THAT NO ON USES"
1779,QUIT VIEWING THE CITIZENS POCKETS AS UNLIMITED AND A WAY TO FUND ALL KINDS OF PET PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE POPULATION.

1786,"Reducing traffic on main streets through Austin, making it easier to get through town without the highways, which also suck."
1787,UN MANGED GROWTH HS MADE AUSTIN LESS ATTRACTIVE OVER THE YEARS. TO THE POINT I LOOK FORWARD TO LEAVING WHEN I RETIRE.
1788,"Austin needs more lower income housing, more affordable housing, lower property taxes, better roads, transportation and mass transit, improve safety on UT campus, address homeless and expand homeless shelters"
1789,HIRE SOMEONE THAT DEALS WITH TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. PLEASE CONSIDER THE OPINIONS THE ONES THAT LIVE AND PAY TAXES IN AUSTIN ONCE IN A WHILE.
1790,"It is a disgrace that most teachers, police, firefighters and state employees cannot afford to live here.  We desperately need transit in all areas.  Traffic is way too congested and dangerous."

1817,stop taxing us out of homes
1818,"Austin needs to get traffic and affordable housing for regular people under control if they want to keep building and growing the economy. Otherwise it will just become another US city with no character, diversity, or distinction."
1819,"Middle class people with child care getting priced out of Austin due to property taxes. It shouldn't cost this much to run a city, as other towns with much less expensive houses are able to do it. This is not a livable city unless a person is upper middle class or has no children."
1820,Austin needs to push through its progressive agenda to deal with growth and transformation to a large city. It can't be held back by naysayers and people scared of change. Do what is best for Austin and ignore those people and (overreaction) by state and national governments.

1879,"If my husband hadn't bought this house in 1993, there is not way we could afford to live in Central Austin. As an employee of AISD, the majority of my colleagues (in my department) live in Pflugerville, Round Rock, and other suburbs. There must be housing stock in the City for EVERYONE. Economic diversity and cultural diversity are evaporating here."

1915,"Streamline the development and permitting process for remodeling one family residences. It is too cumbersome, expensive and time consuming, the requirements for submission require costly hiring of architects, etc. I'm all for protecting mature trees, but the level of scrutiny and regulation is excessive and seems conflicts between what a family's needs are for their home and existing trees are settled always in favor of trees."

1918,Please keep our pools open and help with the traffic and crime.
1919,"Improving city streets is essential for transportation for the vast majority of Austin citizens and for public safety.

Very few citizens actually use bike lanes. We all have to drive cars!"
1920,"Traffic is the thing that most affects my quality of life in Austin. We desperately need better mass transit, specifically train/light rail. Another less expensive fix would be to properly time the freaking traffic lights!"
1921,More bike lanes. More public transit. Less cars.

1935,STOP RAISING MY PROPERTY TAXES! REPLACE PROPERTY TAXES WITH INCOME BASED TAX.

1937,"Make city programs accessible. Would like to know what learning, training and activities are offered by the city of within the library."
1938,"Stop trying to make Austin into New York, Chicago or San Francisco, with policies pushing urban density and mass transit.  The reason those places have mass transit is that their core predates the auto and it was too expensive to retrofit.  Texans like the independence and freedom of the auto, and wide-open spaces (At least in the burbs).  Let it be.  Use taxes for more auto lanes.  (Also support telecommuting.)"
1939,More lighting on streets/parks @ night. Lower homeless population as I don't feel safe downtown because of excessive homeless. Parks in my neighborhood are not safe.
1940,CONTINUE TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE CITY STAYS PREPARED FOR GROWTH. FOCUS ON IMPROVING SCHOOL SYSTEM IN ALL AREAS OF THE CITY.

1964,ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT
1965,Austin needs a new police contract that is favorable to the fire officers of the department.  No more delays!
1966,INCREASE IN THEFT IS UPSETTING. WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT MOVING EVENTUALLY DUE TO UNSAVORY ACTIVITY AND POOR RATINGS AT THE SCHOOL

1971,MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE.
1972,"Traffic - get rid of ""funnel"" roads.  i.e. 4 lanes go to 2 thus creating traffic.  Get a ""real"" light rail - a raised system like a monorail could go down major roadways, use shopping parking lots and you get people to their work and shopping and play.  Monorails are quiet."
1973,I HOPE THE CITY DOES FOCUS ON PRESERVING HISTORY AND MAKING THE CITY ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL .
1974,taxes are out of control
1975,we need lower price housing within the city
1976,"Austin should be easier and safe to bike around in parmer lane is very close to my house and the speed limit is 60 which I find too high it's not safe to bike there next to the cars, the bike lane needs to be separated I would really like to be able to bike to my son's school, grocery stores, playgrounds etc."
1977,"Safety, growth, and traffic are #1.  Then we need to focus on education, culture, fairness, equity, conservation of our resources.  I do feel those of us in zip codes such as 78726 feel left out of city priorities and decisions regularly."

1991,"City growth rates have made taxes and cost of home buying unaffordable to most people that were born and raised in Austin.

1999,"We are losing Austin, Texas trying to make it like other cities.  Taking the streets from vehicles and giving it non taxable bikers.  This not helping traffic at all!  The school taxes may be high but our schools are crumbling and nothing is being done about it.  School administration is making a fortune, not teachers.  And schools are being torn down, not repaired."

I understand the need for revenue, but resent having parking meters around Zilker Park/Greenbelt access and Hike and Bike access at Lady Bird Lake. The meters at Zilker don't until 8:00 am, but those of us who start runs or hikes on greenbelt like to start earlier. We are regular users.

Some of us are being priced out of our longtime homes by soaring home valuations and the resulting taxes, in addition to losing some of the feel of the area that brought us here in the first place.   My long-term plan had been to live out my retirement years in Austin, but over the past year have been rethinking this."

2068,Fix the Traffic lights in this town they cause massive congestion by not being timed well

2081,"Please don't allow Austin ISD to kick churches out of it's facilities. What about religious freedom? Austin should be accepting of ALL views including those of us who choose to follow Jesus Christ. Please don't persecute Christians for our beliefs as the city ""includes"" everyone else."
2082,HOUSING AFFODABILITY
2083,"Our garbage and recycling bins are confusing and unorganized since we are a complex with multiple dwellings and only have bins, such as brown bins recycling signs but do not clarify if are waste or recycling.

2085,"I am leaving Austin because it is too crowded, traffic bad and cost of living is too high."
2086,"We feel the stress of everyday living in this city where we are considering moving out of the state. We can't walk/ride bikes in neighborhood without fear of being hit by speeding cars, especially those that cut through to avoid traffic. It takes me ONE HOUR to drive 5 miles to pick up my kids from school. It's no longer worth living here because it steals time from family and joy. FIX THE TRAFFIC!!! Thanks."

2093,I know we are doing what we can do and it's no revelation but we have to keep a focus on infrastructure and accommodating all these people moving here and the population growth.  I think it's issue #1.
2094,Fix the traffic problems. Let us vote if another Toll is being planned. I want a say in this. It is unfair to all of us not to be able to say we want it or are willing to vote on a bond election for improving highways.
2095,Remove deed restrictions on housing. It's discrimination.
2096,Stop being a sanctuary city. It is driving up the cost of housing and cost of living. Supply vs demand. The more demand we have the more cost goes up. The more people we have the more the cost goes up. If we have people that are illegally here it raises the cost of those of us here. We don't have another county to go to.
2097,"The east side needs lots of improvement to it's infrastructure, roads, sidewalks, etc., as well as basic services like banks and pharmacies.

2102,"I am terrified to drive daily on what I consider to be some of the most dangerous roads in the city - 620 & 2222. The number of lives lost on these roads in any given year is tragic.

2107,"I'm moving away because this really isn't a great place to live. It is sad because Austin has so much to offer, but it is choked off by the city's incompetence towards growth planning. If you can't even surface streets correctly, how can people trust the city to do anything else?"
2108,Need more Police or improved response time and follow up after accidents.
2109,Sad at the lack of job opportunities for college grads like me. I had to live with my parents for four years after college because of this. I am a teacher married to an Austin native currently stationed in Iraq and we can hardly afford to buy a home.
2110,Stop densification. Help citizens not businesses.
2111,Music being played inside cars should not be heard of felt outside of them.
2112,"Help us stay in our homes in our neighborhoods. Help developers develop outside the city core, or adhere to neighborhood-friendly limitations inside the city core. So many of us long-timers have devoted so many volunteer hours to help protect our neighborhoods, that we've helped to transform into safe, desirable places to live, only to see our efforts bypassed by determined developers who have the resources to ignore them. I've given up volunteering and fighting after 10 passionate years because it feels ultimately like lost effort. We need a council that values what has been crafted by community over many years. This does not have to be antithetical to fair, responsible neighborhood-friendly development."
2113,"I am concerned about the lack of affordable housing, the gentrification of downtown and east Austin. The cost of housing increasing so much. Thank you."
2114,"Homeless are out of control. Every corner, tent cities and under bridges. Traffic lights downtown seem designed to stop you at every single light."

2116,Eliminate marketing parking space requirements?
2117,"The tar and gravel repaving system (is poor). Makes a mess. Makes the road surface rough. The leftover gravel sits in gutters forever. I know it's probably cheap, but I hate it."

2124,housing prices inflation is pushing my less fortunate neighbors out of the area
2125,"EDUCATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIAL MOBILITY, IN ORDER TO GIVE CITIZENS THE MOST OPPORTUNITY WE MUST FOCUS ON ATTRACTING TOP TALENT TO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. HIGHER SALARIES AND HIGHER SELECTION CRITERIA WILL MAKE SURE THAT AUSTIN CONTINUES TO BE A DESIREABLE PLACE TO LIVE"

2142,Teachers struggle here. I know more and more teachers who have plans to leave the district/career because of a multitude of factors. Help our younger generation and invest in them and things for them. Teachers should be planning to better their career not planning to leave it.

2149,"Please plan for the massive influx of people moving to the city. Please increase the capacity of the convention center and let's make that area safe for our visitors. As an event manager who plans a convention there every year, we want to keep people coming and spending money in the city."

2151,Fix traffic
2152,"Land and communal spaces in and around District 1 and the Cameron Road/183 area desperately need improvements. Two new schools recently opened near there, and there is not a safe way for families to walk or bike to the school, creating greater traffic challenges in an already congested area."

2154,Improve schools and affordability of the city!
2155,"Please do something for property-owning residents! We are paying for this non-stop party and we get nothing for our money. Your focus is on tourists and businesses. These policies have made the city unlivable. The only reason we are here is our jobs. We are looking for another city when we retire. This city is unsustainable. The only reason it has made it this far is because people move here because they hear it is cool. They move here, spend mom and dad's money on high rent and booze, go broke and then move back home. The next day, they are replaced by two others waiting to get their spot. This is the city that you built. And why did you pay for a Kansas company to do this survey? UT could have done it and you would keep the money in this town. Typical."
2156,How can citizens get involved?
2157,Transportation and affordable housing are huge issues. Please keep up the good work with environmental/sustainability initiatives and code enforcement. It could and should be easier for small businesses to build/expand. It's so dollar-only big brick and mortar. Chain stores can afford it.

2160,Lower property taxes!
2161,"We must build a mass transit network and rezone for high-density, mixed-use development along transit corridors. Buses that get stuck in traffic are not a solution. People will only vote to fund a train if the path makes sense. North Lamar to South Congress, not Highland to East Riverside."
2162,The toll roads don't help traffic.
2163,Get over your political career b.s. and serve our community or quit.

2205,"traffic, Austin is losing its heart, all the things that make Austin are being priced out either from real estate, high taxes, or new development while recognized about the money in their own pocket than retaining Austin's unique culture and make it an affordable place to live, if I didn't own my own home I wouldn't be able to afford rent as a single person anymore and I make decent money that fact deeply saddens me for Austin's future"

2257,"THANK YOU FOR HELPING AUSTIN BEONE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE PLACES TO OLIVE, BEAUTIFUL FREENSPACES, AND A WELCOMING CULTURE"
2258,"I love the City, but the overcrowding is making it less enjoyable.  This town was a place for artists, musicians and people trying to express themselves.  It has lost some of that magic-people can't afford to be artists here any more."
2259,Cost of living is too high.  We are losing artist and musicians that use to make the City special.
2260,No soccer stadium.

2263,DISCOURAGE FOSSIL FUELS
2264,Reduce property taxes.
2265,HELP US CLEAN UP OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND FEEL SAFE AGAIN.
2266,Homeless issue is getting out of hand and trashing our city. They should be required to keep areas clean. Housing prices for middle class should be more affordable.
2267,Provide cultural events. The COA does not plan events geared towards minority involvement.
2268,Please help with traffic problems. I ride a bike to work (with no bike lane) and it's dangerous.
2269,"During Mayor Adler's term I've personally experienced my property taxes increase to a sum of 46%. How is this affordable, much less, sustainable? In addition, I've experienced the City's Code Enforcement and Energy divisions aggressive and inequitable enforcement of city codes/fees, price rates, rules and or regulations of life-time east Austin residents. All under the under the guise of ""enforcement"" and or ""safety"", yet the division's  gestapo like tactics are not used of newly approved city council residential/commercial building contractors, permits or new comers/residents to the neighborhood."
2270,Get rid of the toll roads.  Why did we have to get rid of the Montopolis Fly over?
2271,"STOP BUILDING --NEED MORE ROADS, LESS PEOPLE-STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR WALLET--MAKE AUSTIN BEAUTIFUL AGAIN."
2272,leave montopolis alone

2283,"Seniors deserve more incentives to stay in Austin. Discount on electrical and water services.  After 65, we pay less for taxes, but no other incentives. I use lees water and electricity than families."
2284,TO HELP WITH RISING HOUSING COST CRACK DOWN ON MISUSE OF SHORT TERM RENTAL IE. AIR BNB AND GENTRIFICATION THE CITY OF DC JUST HAD A SHORT TERM RENTAL BILL PROPOSED THAT COULD ALSO HELP US WITH RENT COST
2285,LIGHT RAIL AND BUSES NOT GREAT. NEED ELEVATED RAIL.
2286,Stream line the permitting process to build a new home.
2287,WE ARE LOSING OUR GREEN SPACES.
2288,Austin is a wonderful place to live and I consider myself lucky to be here. There is room for improvement - affordable/moderate rentals and home ownership opportunities must be a priority as well as improving traffic. Long term residents are losing faith in City Government as inequities are not addressed.
2289,Focus on handling growth: traffic/housing/expanding services to growing areas
2290,Austin is not representing itself as a capital city. Embassies are in Houston. Big businesses are going to Dallas and Houston. Why not Austin?
2291,"Get out of the way, you can't be everything to everybody so quit trying. AND, get rid of the homeless instead of inviting them in by giving them they're needs. Identify the truly needy and concentrate on those few."
2292,"He is doing a great job. Setting planning for growth, transportation and mobility together is an excellent approach."
2293,"THE CITY IS GROWING FASTER THAN IT CAN HANDLE. THE LIMIT WILL BE REACHED, THEN WHAT? THE RESIDENTS ARE MOVING OUT IF THEY CAN TO AVOID PAYING THE HIGH PROPERTY TAXES AND TRAFFIC"
2294,"PLEASE PAY EQUAL ATTENTION TO PEOPLE RESIDING IN AREAS DISTANT FROM THE DOWNTOWN AREAS. DON'T LET US DEPEND ON NEIGHBORING CITIES CLOSE TO US TO PROVIDE CONVENIENCES FOR WHICH WE ARE TAXED BY THE CITY OF AUSTIN. GIVE US CLOSER POOLS, LIBRARIES, PARKS, ETC. THANK YOU"
2295,"TAXES ARE HIGH, TRAFFIC SUCKS."
2296,THE CITY OF AUSTIN IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CORRUPT MANAGERS THAT ARE HIRING AT THE CITY.

2302,police response is terrible. usually no show
2303,Traffic is getting harder. People need to slow down. Unsafe.
2304,We need designated camping areas for the homeless so there are toilets and showers . They could get plugged into services more effectively.
2305,GOOD PLACE TO LIVE. USED TO BE GREAT NOW JUST GOOD BECAUSE OF EXPENSIVE COST OF LIVING AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION.
2306,Please fulfill public works tickets fairly!!! I feel discriminated against. There is no other reason I can see for why my neighbor's same issue was fixed and not mine.
2307,"PROPERTY TAXES ARE OUT OF CONTROL, I NEED RELIEF!!!"
2308,AUSTIN NEEDS TO REMAIN AFFORDABLE TO LIVE FOR ALL PEOPLE. WE CAN'T BECOME ANOTHER SAN FRANCISCO.

2312,"focus on traffic, it is horrible for everyone"
2313,Bring down our property taxes - that is a huge burden on retirees.

2315,"Please be strategic on the growth of the city, promoting economic attractiveness of our city but also plan to support such growth.  Let's follow Singapore's example of a well planned and successful city."
2316,"Austin is already a ""desirable"" place to live, work to make it an ""affordable"" place to live through multiple approaches."
2317,"CITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE WORKING TO HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE, THERE SHOULD NOT BE SPECIAL INTEREST FOR ANY GROUPS."
2318,Traffic is a problem
2319,"Medicare and Medicaid support to vision, dental and ears"
2320,base your decisions on evidence based research and plan accordingly
2321,INCREASE EMPLOYEE WAGES
2322,"WHY ARE YOU NOT USING THE HOME DEPOT FACILITY TO WORK UP A PROGRAM FOR THE HOMELESS?? 
STAY OUT OF THE ""HOUSING"" BUSINESS, ALLOW FREEDOM TO DEVELOPERS, PROPERTY OWNERS TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR PROPERTIES. ELIMINATE 50% ON YOUR ""COMMISSIONS"" REDUCE THE NUMBERS ON THE REMAINING COMMITTEES, TIME LIMITS TO COUNCIL MEETINGS, EVEN IF ISSUES HAVE TO DRAG ON - INACTION CAN BE A WONDERFUL BENEFIT. CONSOLIDATE CODE ENFORCEMENT INTO THE PERMITTING/INSPECTION DEPARTMENTS. REDUCE COSTS!!! REDUCE DEBT!!! ALLOW OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TO GENERATE THEIR OWN MARKETS AND CHARACTER."
2323,I think that creating better public transportation is the only way to help ease the traffic concerns in Austin.
2324,"I think the city's attitude to a lot of issues with livability is:  ""housing prices, and therefore your net worth, are increasing, so we are doing ok and you are doing ok.""  If I am correct, the problem is that the individual or family tax burden increases in kind, and the only way to realize this value increase is to sell the home and move out of Austin."
2325,Lower property tax and increase public schools
2326,Lower the property taxes.
2327,"Stop making plans for your future career in Democratic politics and run the darn city.  Oh, and fire Cronk.  He's gonna ruin this town."
2328,We need affordable housing and water rates

2330,"Appropriately fund the Police Department so that Austin, the 11th largest city in the US,  meets a national standard for law enforcement."
2331,No tax rebate or subsidy to for profit corporations.
2332,Reduce traffic congestion on the roads
2333,HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND PROPERTY TAXES TOO HIGH
2334,WORK WITH CAP METRO TO EXPAND LIGHT RAIL

2354,WE SEE THE MAYOR IS DOING HIS BEST TO IMPROVE AUSTIN AND MAKE AUSTIN THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE. WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. GOOD JOB MAYOR!!
2355,PUBLIC TRANSIT IS CRUCIAL TO GROWTH OF CITY.
2356,Work on the quality of drinking water.  Reduce the water and electric bills.
2357,Deregulation in electric service providers. Better rebates for solar power at residence. Better rain water harvesting programs. Better cultural exchange with those from India.
2358,BETTER MASS TRANSIT
2359,"ENSURE AUSTIN REMAINS A BULWARK AGAINST WHITE CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM, EVEN WHILE THE CITY IS INCREASINGLY SURROUNDED AND PRESSURED BY IT'S INSIDIOUS PROPONENTS."
2360,It is difficult to find a list of parks with Pavilions.
2361,"Biggest issue is taxes, which is really a State issue. Related to school taxes, which the Mayor has little say."
2362,Salary adjustments for cost of living in Austin.
2363,"Something as simple as timing traffic lights better, could easily reduce congestion in a big way. It doesn't all need to be new road construction. Also, trimming trees that cover street signs would be very helpful."
2364,To better enforce traffic laws with respect to aggressive and dangerous drivers.  And hire ethical and honest people!
2365,"TRAFFIC, WE NEED AN ELECTRIC SHUTTLE SYSTEM."
2366,"Traffic and property tax, both need fixing."
2367,Recreation centers are concentrated in Central Austin. Most of them are not accessible by North West Austin community. We need a new recreation center for indoor sports in North West Austin.
2368,Traffic and noise from construction
2369,"Please resign and let someone else run the city.  In fact the same goes to at least several of the city council members.  If you want to get involved in national politics, please run for another elected office.  There are many problems facing a growing city like Austin.  We need a mayor who has undivided attention to make Austin a better place to live.  We need more roads (not bike lanes), larger police force, and more affordable housing.  It's not very complicated if you focus on the right problem."
2370,"Please approve new development and also keep the beauty of the city with the best quality of life for people.
Everything is bigger in Texas, we can expand our downtown wider and taller at the same time. 
I know traffic is a growing problem, people who work in tech can help to solve this with a new design. We can also help identify the cause for slow moving traffic.
We can use our homeless population to keep city and lakes clean, thus helping each other. 
Thank you."

2375,"public transportation development, more bus/train lanes, frequency"
2376,LOWER OUR TAXES AND STOP WASTING OUR MONEY
2377,I would like to thank the Mayor for trying to solve the traffic issue on Mopac and 183 (towards airport). We should have if not already started planning to see more growth of Austin as a city and make sure that housing/rent is still affordable for all.
2378,"find a way to keep property taxes low - we see a lot of our neighbors having to move away because their property taxes have risen too much, too quickly in the last few years and the trend is continuing"
2379,Need to improve transportation
2380,"Establish reliable mass transit system - preferably not on street level (e.g. subway, monorail) - that connects east, south, and north Austin. Austin is too dense to continue to have unreliable bus system that only exacerbates the traffic problem. Establishing better transit system would encourage less personally owned vehicles on the road too."
2381,Police availability and response.
2382,Good work on keeping Austin friendly!
2383,Support initiative for Lyft.
2384,move the homeless shelter out of the prime real estate in downtown Austin.  make people pay a fine if they give money to pan handlers in street intersections!  this is dangerous because it causes car accidents.  I have witnessed this myself.
2385,Transport all these bums to a different city and get our transportation highway issue fixed. One lane off and on ramps - are you crazy? Your toll road Texas tag needs to encompass ALL the toll roads in Texas. It is so confusing to get toll road bills from two different companies. Forget the toll roads and make legit highway alternatives to I-35. One traffic accident on I-35 causes congestion for miles. See if you can have a helicopter lift the two wrecked cars off the highway so traffic can resume back to normal quicker. Make an emergency traffic lane gate that opens only for EMS and police so that they can get to the traffic accident quicker and tow the cars off into the emergency lane.
2386,PERHAPS JOB FINDING PROGRAMS. OR INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE.
2387,Thank you for improving Parque Zaragoza.
2388,"CODENEXT HAD A GOOD END GOAL. ALLOW DENSIFICATION TO TAKE PLACE TO COMBAT THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE. THE MISSING INGREDIENT IS PLACE BASED DESIGN. THE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED NEED A STRONG VOICE AS POLICY MAKERS AND SHOULD BE ADVOCATES FOR THE COMMUNITY. ALSO, PASS THE GREEN LINE PLEASE."
2389,"Quit trying to provide things to people at the expense of others. Anything worth having is worth working for. You think if we give it to them they will work up to keep it, they invest nothing and have nothing to lose. You spend others money very liberally, why not spend your own?"
2390,"lower the property tax , water n electric fee"
2391,CITY GOLF COURSES SHOULD BE OPEN TO ALL PUBLIC.

2409,PLEASE IMPROVE TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION.
2410,IT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL IF WE HAD A BETTER TRANSIT SYSTEM SUCH AS A TRAIN. I THINK IT WOULD HELP REDUCE TRAFFIC.
2411,Lower the property tax.
2412,I THINK IMPROVEMENTS AT THE AIRPORT AND TRAFFIC AROUND THE CITY WOULD HELP TAKE OVER CITY TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
2413,Fix traffic
2414,Good job overall!  Pay more attention to the road conditions and traffic issues.
2415,THE SEAL COAT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS VERY POOR QUALITY.
2416,We need to accelerate the approved timeline of licensing and permitting for a new business.  There are too many homeless people living under the freeways and sleeping in front of small local businesses.
2417,"growth in infrastructure project should match with the growth in city economy while it is important to bring more business tot he city to generate more revenue, it is equally important  to focus on the quality of life in the city as well. traffic, climbing rate and property value will eventually push people away and make Austin the worst place to live and work"
2418,expand available events venues outside of downtown and/or create better traffic flow and parking downtown
2419,When is the traffic going to get better?? What are the plans in regards to better traffic?
2420,Initiate programs that will help lower property taxes. Every initiative the city taxes increases property taxes. Be innovative.
2421,Make Austin more affordable to live in. Taxes are running ahead of inflation & income growth.
2422,Transportation system needs a new plan otherwise big companies can't come here.
2423,hope you can come up with a solution to improve traffic on 290 at Y in oak hill and reduce speed limit on FM1826

2444,"Improve the infrastructure for continued growth of our city, especially for traffic.  Listen to the citizens on the options we prefer."
2445,"Make the budget smaller.  Do more with less.  When money is tight in our house, we spend less.  We are taxed to the gills and the City ALWAYS say MORE!  But you spend it on things that are not important.  Build your base.  The Family.  The tax payer!!  We own homes and have stable jobs.  We pay our taxes.  Work for us, not those people who cry the loudest."
2446,We need 3000 Permanent Supportive Housing vouchers and SW staff to support them. Please.
2447,"Make commute easier - time the lights, construction is ok but it is at the inconvenience of commute - common sense to reset or time the lights.  We can learn from Houston or Dallas - very well timed lights."

2478,HOMELESS SITUATION SLEEPING ON SIDEWALKS AND UNDER BRIDGES. HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE THIS SHAME ON YOU MAYOR.
2479,"We need to address the homeless problem and the traffic issues. Austin's traffic is becoming a real burden on its citizens and the lack of public transportation and lack of density will both make traveling across the city too burdensome, time-consuming. This will not only affect quality of living but also be bad for business. Please let's come up with incentives for the private sector to support the city in making public transportation a priority."
2480,"In spite of its tremendous growth spurt, Austin continues to be a beautiful and enticing city.  Would never live anywhere else but I am worried of the cost of living and the taxes since I getting to the point where I will be on a fixed income."

Use technology to explore the solutions to issues instead of trying solutions for other areas that may not work here.  Shape the box."
2490,I would like to see community police.   It may be old school but trust in government starts at what should be the most visible.
2491,Inviting the homeless to camp in Austin is a terrible idea. We don't want Austin to become San Francisco.
2492,"Please stop letting those big companies infiltrate downtown and inside the 15min bubble, our city cant handle all those extra people they bring in for jobs (their families, the traffic, the roads, the taxes, the parking, the rent) This is the best city and we want to keep it that way by not pushing out the locals that have made it that way!"

2496,"Improve transportation by building better roads and highways without them being toll roads.  We pay for the bonds & taxes to build roads and then we have to pay more to use them?  We can not afford to use the new roads and highways if you make them all Toll Roads.  This will not fix the transportation problem.
AND please do not raise taxes for Home Owners, it puts a lot of pressure and we can not afford to live in our own homes.  You want to fix all the budget problems by having homeowners pay for it.  That is why most of my co-workers live in Bastrop, Round Rock, or Kyle."
2497,"School and teacher, child care teachers pay"
2498,"Truly value minorities as equals without using their income as a measure for their worth. Focus on improving  the quality of life for your low income minority (black/brown/immigrant, disabled, senior) residents before trying to increase the growth of the city; which negatively impacts those residents by widening the income inequality gap.
Increasing efforts to invest more in social services  for lower income residents allows them to get the adequate resources they would otherwise be unable to access, and  potentially keeping them in a cycle of poverty/debt."
2499,Thank you for your service
2500,"Homeless problem, maybe find or create simple jobs like mowing the empty lots or picking up trash."
2501,"You are not the mayor of California. Californians are not your constituents, we are. We are being forced to move out of the city because it is no longer affordable. Hispanic and African American neighborhoods are being gentrified everyday and nothing is being done to help the long-time residents that are being forced out of their homes. And because they are poor and minorities, you don't seem to care about it."
2502,We need solutions to the high cost of living. They (the mayor and council) need to do more for the working class.  Instead of worrying about attracting more condo developers. Many of us born and raised here in Austin are hanging on by threads to afford our hometown.   That's not right.  They mayor and council are allowing the people and local businesses that made austin special beautiful and unique vanish .  They mayor and council have all shown they have sold our city out for the all mighty dollar.  And most importantly the mayor has made our city a disgusting filthy and unsafe place by allowing the homeless to overtake our formerly beautiful city.
2503,Cost of housing is ridiculously high. Build an other bridge across town lake to East of IH35.
2504,"PLEASE help the homeless. decisions in this ""situation"" will be hard and distasteful.... But People will start leaving... and go somewhere else...."
2505,Taxes and housing do something stop just talking

2507,Please do something to reduce the number of homeless people on each intersection. They don't seem to be needy if people provide them with living conditions or material means to survive under bridges to smoke and drink. Thank you.
2508,"Get rid of the dumbest rule : camping allowed pretty much anywhere! 
NO ENFORCEMENT so it has become DANGEROUS! We are FED UP WITH IT!! You claim it has not caused more homeless people but you are wrong! My neighborhood has become a giant camping ground full of trash, junk, aggressive homeless thieves!!"
2509,control homelessness. It's creating a feeling of uneasiness for communities and also creating a safety concern for Austin and the people who want to visit us.
2510,TAXES ARE TOO HIGH
2511,"Too many bike lanes.  I do not like those posts being placed on the streets in order to make more bike lanes.  My understanding that is that you have a council member and since he rides bikes pretty much of what he says happens.  Well, I do not like what it is doing to the streets, all of those posts and the narrow streets are making it difficult to maneuver around pedestrians/children.  The cyclist are now riding two or three abreast making it even more dangerous, please, no more bike lanes in our neighborhood."
2512,STOP THE GENTRIFICATION ON RIVERSIDE and overall Austin
2513,Help the homeless so we can keep Austin clean. Everywhere you look there's trash. In all of my 67 years in Austin I've never seen such filth.
2514,LACK OF DIVERSITY AND CITY SEGREGATION

2526,Please decrease the number of homeless people littering our city!
2527,"I wish I didn't think to myself, ""I liked Austin a lot more in the 1980's"", so often. Some things have improved, but many have worsened. I realize much is inevitable due to urban growth, but many cities across the globe have maintained their unique cultures despite their growth...I hope Austin can do it too."
2528,Cheaper rent for single mothers
2529,"STOP GIVING TAX BREAKS TO CORPORATIONS, IT IS A RANSOM THAT THE WORKERS HAVE TO PAY."
2530,REMEMBER AUSTIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FRIENDLY CITY.
2531,I AGREE WITH THE CITY'S POSITION ON THE NEED FOR RESIDENTIAL DENSITY IN THE URBAN CORE. PROVIDING MORE DENSE AND VARIED HOUSING IS IMPORTANT FOR AFFORDABILITY.

2545,Please continue to address city's infrastructure in dealing with population growth.
2546,"Mayor, I appreciate the desire to house the homeless, I think that is something that we need to do. However, I also feel that the residence in the north east sector of town keep getting overlooked. In the areas of police protection, maintece of city property such as the sidewalks and  maintaining the areas adjacent to main streets,  lighting, and Timely response from 311 and 911 calls.  Often our neighbors have been broken into, our mailboxes have been broken into, our cars have been broken into, and somehow no one ever gets caught. I have no choice but to ask myself how does the treatment  residents in my neighborhood compare to the treatment of residence in more affluent neighborhoods.  Respectfully yours, Maria Elsa Rodriguez, 36-year resident at Copperfield subdivision"

2555,the businesses that supply tax revenue to Austin's coffers deserve better attention than they have been given in regards to helping them maintain a business friendly environment when it comes to homeless loitering in and around their premises.
2556,"To ensure people all across this city are treated equally.  
 I live in Southeast Austin near  William Cannon and McKinney Falls Parkway and have made at least two requests to 311 over the past year to have my street repaired and the request has been ignored.
I house sat for a friend last week that lives near Mopac and 32nd St. and called 311 requesting a pothole in the street to be repaired around 11:45 AM.   When I arrived back at her house at 5:00 PM that VERY SAME DAY,  that pothole and a couple of others were repaired."
2557,"Make sure that the camping everywhere in the streets ordice is revalued. Downtown is turning into an unhospitable street jungle full of unemployed, drug users that create waste and are unsafe to the other citizens paying the taxes. 
Stop talking about affordable housing and actually create some.  Developers will not create anything affordable since there is not incentive to sell cheaper houses when you can build and sell million dollar mansions."
2558,I love Austin been here all my life. I am disappointed how we are handling the homeless population.
2559,"Sir, can you please do something about the driving test. I feel like it's out of date and many people young to old should be tested in a better way."
2560,New homeless ordice is a nuisance and an eyesore to our great city.
2561,Get rid of the tent city plan.

Some enjoy their life..  Hey no taxes."
2571,"Stop adding more FTEs to both general fund and enterprise departments. Focus on departments operating efficiently rather than giving them additional FTEs. Also, tell the truth about homelessness in the media and how many of them are bused here from other cities/communities. Ask the big tech firms to pitch in and help address the homelessness issue ficially to build community such as Community First Village."
2572,Give it's city employees a bigger pay raise.  as inflation continues to increase our pay checks are not.

2576,"Try to foresee planning on travel throughout the city versus building first. Its because of the Rapid growth there isn't anywhere to reach your destination . Also maybe if possible look at a Truck route using 130 so traffic on 35 won't be so bad like starting out at Sun City and come out in Buda , San Marcos and pose fines on 18 wheeler's caught in city . But discount rates for them to use 130 ."
2577,Life should not be so expensive so parent don't have to work both full time to be able to nearly live a normal life.
2578,"Please slow down the growth of Austin to allow the residents and the citizens to adjust and grow with the city.

 2. Loss of driving lanes to bicycles"
2582,"Your affordable housing isn't working. You are only catering to the ones who can afford the fancy expensive apartments and homes. what about us plain working folk,  we cant

2589,Homeless situation in Downtown is hideous and needs to be addressed urgently. They do need to be removed from Downtown.
2590,"Deal with the traffic - it looks bad, it tastes bad and it is unhealthy and not safe. Every day it's like a free for all on I 35 for sure!
Deal with the homeless population - building low cost/affordable homes isn't the only way - clean up their ""villages"", cite them for infringing on the roadway, etc.  It's gone beyond ridiculous and is unhealthy, unsafe and in the areas where the homeless congregate - you are really losing some of the aura of why folks want to live in Austin - because visitors, etc. see city that is deteriorating and not being kept up.
Sorry that's two - but both need to be said."
2591,More lighting at night on highway 71 heading toward Bee Caves.
2592,"Please try to do more on affordable housing. Too many people can't afford to live here anymore. We can't all work for Facebook and Google, making $100,00/year. Say not to Amazon."

2596,Improve traffic congestion!
2597,Keep Austin Affordable. Do not recycle your people out of Austin to round rock or other urban cities out of Austin.

2599,"Please listen to the people of Austin with their concerns about safety , and  support  them in their efforts to protect Their  children  and private properties. 
I'm really concerned about what I'm seeing. 
Let's truly lead by example by supporting the little guys  as  well as  the big guys in matters of  growth,  development  , in all areas including education, safety , health but most importantly community support and guidance. People start to panic when they reach out for help and have no where to turn, it's actually very dangerous  because it leads to mental health issues( man that flew his private plane into  IRS office  off Mopac  a few years ago,)  that's desperation 
And feeling lost.  If you build it , they will come, but are you really prepared Austin, or just pretending?  Lots of growth too quickly and  we need the right people leading us into the future, our lives are in your hands...."

2604,Lower the taxes on our utility bill that would help out. Thank you
2605,"I grew up on the east-side of Austin. I love that Austin is evolving, growing and has a ton of opportunity but we have to stop displacing families that have been here for generations. I've watched as the generation before me is forced to move to the suburbs and lose connections with lifelong friends and neighbors and access to this incredible city and all it has to offer. There has to be some way we can allow families to stay in their homes and co-exist with new neighbors. If there is way to sort of ""grandfather"" in property tax rates to residents that have lived in a house for a certain number of years it may help the problem of gentrification. The people moving in love authentic culture and food but also force out (probably unknowingly) the people who that culture belongs to.  Let's keep Austin welcoming for EVERYONE, not just for the new residents, but our native ones too."
2606,"Fixes residential streets that need it! Waste of money fixing South Congress and Otltort. Be concerned to all people living pay check to pay check. STOP giving incentives to large corporate businesses by allowing them NOT to pay taxes while longtime residents are loosing their home due to high taxes on property and school taxes, etc. Disabled people's taxes continue to increase too much. What can be done about that?"
2607,Give landlords credit for renting affordable housing. My rentals do not make me a profit. I eat into my savings to pay my taxes.
2608,Keep promoting a progressive agenda.
2609,"*To fine construction companies that do not finish jobs they have signed contracts to finish in  a timely manner.
* To demolish the monstrosity of the unfinished apartments behind the H-E-B on  McCallen Pass and Tech Ridge... near the Gold's Gym.  The drywall is peeling and ghostly. A costly project that was started and never finished leaving a mess and mold...could be very hazardous to the public in the area...get some money back there and fine the abandoning companies."
2610,"Work to reduce Public Safety costs (reduce APD, AFD, etc.)"
2611,Lower rent or higher pay to be able to live and work in Austin. Moving out of Austin makes it hard for single parents to find affordable trustworthy daycare/after school care with extended hours with Austin traffic these days.
2612,"Please fix our streets and stop spending money on useless items (courthouse, bike lanes, light rail)."
2613,We can always be improving but overall Austin is a great place to live.
2614,Troy Gay is unethical and should probably be in jail for how he handled the DNA (non-issue). He's going to destroy what is left of the police department.
2615,"So many homeless people at all traffic lights and all around the city, never have seen any sign of concern for this huge situation in this city, I don't feel safe at all each time I stopped at a traffic light"
2616,We need light rail or mono rail something new instead of buses which causes some of the traffic congestion.  Gondolas or something similar  running along IH35 would eliminate some traffic problems and would be unique to Austin!!!
2617,The electricity bill in summer is just expensive
2618,Give benefits back to APD or Austin is going to be another Chicago crime is getting worse. People are noticing it.

2624,Why is property taxes so high
2625,If there was any way he or she could help with getting the living cost in Austin lower it would help a lot of people they wouldn't have to work 2 jobs just to pay rent and they could relax a little if they weren't so worried about making sure they were going to be able to pay rent each month

2633,"This is a beautiful city, but a lot of people are being victims of gentrification and this should be addressed fairly"
2634,Fix the traffic and fix property taxes. Stop telling people you aren't raising their taxes when their bill is actually going up. If prop. values go up then taxes go up regardless of the percentage being charged.
2635,Property taxes are too high and traffic is getting worse every day.
2636,"We need light rail, we need to stop the gentrification of East Austin, we need to repave all the major arteries (roads) that come into Austin.  Business will be leaving once their workers can't get into town."
2637,There needs to be more affordable housing for those who qualify for these services.
2638,"The city of Austin need to go back to being more affordable.  It used to be affordable to live here, eat here, and play here and now it's not.  If I were to rent my home out, according to my realtor, I could for $2800 a month and that is insane to me.  REALLY INSANE!!  After living in Austin for 27 years I am actually thinking about moving and renting my home so that I can live more comfortably and make a profit from my home."

2657,Traffic and affordability for teachers/civil servants who work in Austin.
2658,The east side should be called the white east side because the city has kicked the blacks and Hispanics out!  We cannot afford to stay where we were raised!  We're having to sell our homes in order to eat.  We can't get help from the government if we're not from Cuba!  Cuba residents get more money for school than if you were born here!
2659,SCOOTERS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN FLOW. THEY SHOW NO RESPECT FOR DRIVERS OR WALKERS. PUT THAT MONEY TO BETTER CITY TRANSPORTATION.
2660,"CITY GROWTH SHOULD BE KEPT IN CHECK, UNTIL WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE, LIKE ROADS, UTILITIES."

While an increase in population is always on the rise, we do not see the extra money taken from our taxes being  planted back into our communities, and instead have higher rates of transient activity, mental health issues, criminal activity, low income or section 8 housing, aggressive driving in school zones, poor quality of equally priced and easily accessible healthy food, and tobacco sales than ever before and comparatively to most large subsection neighborhoods (NE, NC, NW, SE, etc.)"

2871,"I am proud to be an Austinite and I love the fact that Austin is growing and attracting people from everywhere.  However, as much changes as I've seen in parts like Rainey St and the Domain, there are places in Austin that do not change.  I don't know why but I am referring to places such as low income houses and apartments that look the same or worse than they did 10 years ago.

Why do we owe them a home? Do you owe me a home? Unbelievable.

Also - plan in closed session how to prevent state legislators from passing bills negating and opposing local community issues i.e. minimum wage and bag bans."
2908,Police department needs to step up and investigate and go after people who break into mailboxes and cars. Also when businesses are conducting shady business practices they need to return phone calls and investigate and help with evictions.  And the roads need to be expanded if we are going to build all these apartment complexes. Incomes needs to rise with increase property values so people can afford homes.
